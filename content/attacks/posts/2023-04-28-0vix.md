## Security Failure Causes

- **Flash Loans Exploitation:** The exploit leveraged flash loans, which allow borrowing large sums without collateral, for price manipulation and creating strain on the system.
- **Price Oracle Manipulation:** The attackers manipulated price oracles, leading the protocol to make decisions based on incorrect asset prices.
- **Toxic Liquidation Spiral Vulnerability:** The protocol was vulnerable to aggressive and poorly managed liquidations, which led to further financial strain.
