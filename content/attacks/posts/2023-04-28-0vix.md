## Security Failure Causes

- **Flash Loans Exploitation:** The exploit leveraged flash loans, which allow borrowing large sums without collateral, for price manipulation and creating strain on the system.
- **Price Oracle Manipulation:** The attackers manipulated price oracles, leading the protocol to make decisions based on incorrect asset prices.
- **Toxic Liquidation Spiral Vulnerability:** The protocol was vulnerable to aggressive and poorly managed liquidations, which led to further financial strain.
- **Inadequate Monitoring:** Lack of sufficient monitoring and safeguards failed to detect and prevent suspicious activities before the attack was executed. The attacker deployed a few similar contracts around an hour before the attack from different wallets ([1](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xbef0a2a4885ea5df895047f49c202525b73dcc68), [2](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb3d204ee119547faa7be6796a31ca773c24b1fdc))
