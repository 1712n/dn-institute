title: Hackers Breach Qubit Finance Platform, Stealing $80 Million
---

## Summary

On January 28, 2022, Qubit Finance, a project built on the BNB Chain (formerly known as Binance Smart Chain), announced a breach of its QBridge credit protocol on their Twitter page. The platform was hacked due to a specific vulnerability in the bridge. Hackers were able to mint an unlimited amount of xETH as collateral for loans on the Binance Smart Chain network.

## Attackers

The perpetrators remain unidentified.

## Losses

A huge amount of xETH was issued, used as collateral, and took about $80 million worth of tokens from the pool.

## Timeline

- **January 28, 2022:** PeckShield, a blockchain security and smart contract audit company, confirmed the exploit.

## Security Failure Causes

CertiK Security reported that the attacker called the deposit function in the QBridge contract, but did not deposit funds. Ethereum QBridge recorded the deposit event and released $qXETH to the hacker on the BSC blockchain. The hacker repeated the procedure several times, increasing production to nearly $80 million.
> "QBridge treats the deposit event as a #ETH replenishment because the 'deposit' and 'depositETH' methods in the QBridge contract fire the same event."

## Lessons Learned From The Attack

The Qubit hack was made possible by the fact that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).  Their overlapping functionality and vulnerabilities that allowed fake deposits made this hack possible.

The existence of legacy code in the contract indicates issues with code review and change management.  Similarly, the vulnerabilities that allowed the fake deposit might have been detected during a smart contract audit.

## Additional Details

- Qubit Finance is a DeFi lending protocol optimized for lending on the Binance Smart Chain.
- The platform's native token, QBT, collapsed 31% in two hours and is currently trading at an all-time low of $0.004, 99-2% below its September all-time high of $0.58.
