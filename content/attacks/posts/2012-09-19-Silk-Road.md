---

## Summary

On 19th September 2012, James Zhong exploited the Silk Road dark web marketplace and was convicted for committing wire fraud. He managed to unlawfully obtain over 50,000 Bitcoin. Law enforcement seized approximately 50,676 Bitcoin from Zhong's residence, valued at over $3.36 billion. This seizure marked the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice.

## Attackers

James Zhong, the attacker, executed a scheme to defraud Silk Road of Bitcoin by creating approximately nine accounts. He managed to trigger over 140 transactions in rapid succession, fooling Silk Road’s withdrawal-processing system. He moved the Bitcoin to separate addresses to prevent detection and obfuscate the source of the Bitcoin.

## Losses

Silk Road sustained a loss of approximately 50,676 Bitcoin, valued at over $3.36 billion at the time of the seizure. The funds were fully returned following the seizure.

## Timeline

- **September 19, 2012:** Zhong exploited the Silk Road, obtaining approximately 50,000 Bitcoin.
- **August 2017:** Zhong received a matching amount of Bitcoin Cash following a hard fork coin split, which he later exchanged for additional Bitcoin.
- **November 9, 2021:** The authorities seized 50,676 Bitcoin and other assets from Zhong’s residence in Gainesville, Georgia.
- **November 4, 2022:** Zhong pled guilty to his charges before the United States District Judge Paul G. Gardephe.
- **February 22, 2023:** Zhong is scheduled to be sentenced.

## Security Failure Causes

**Silk Road’s Withdrawal-Processing System:** The security failure in Silk Road's withdrawal-processing system allowed Zhong to trick the platform into releasing approximately 50,000 Bitcoin.

**Bitcoin Anonymity:** The pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin enabled Zhong to initially hide his fraudulent activities and the source of the Bitcoin.

**Insufficient Account Security:** Silk Road's account creation process allowed Zhong to register multiple accounts with only minimal information, facilitating his fraudulent activities.
