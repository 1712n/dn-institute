## Summary

On June 23, 2022, the Harmony Protocol team discovered a malicious attack on their Horizon Bridge, a blockchain bridge enabling asset transfers between Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Harmony blockchains. In the morning, several transactions compromised the bridge. The hackers were able to steal the following assets: Frax (FRAX), Wrapped Ether (WETH), Aave (AAVE), Sushi (SUSHI), Frax Share (FXS), AAG (AAG), Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), Tether (USDT), Wrapped BTC (WBTC), and USD Coin (USDC). Some of these tokens have been exchanged for ETH on decentralized exchanges.

## Attackers

The FBI has officially announced that the Lazarus Group and APT38, North Korean organizations, were responsible for the breach. The FBI also shared that the hackers, identified as "cyber actors associated with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," utilized a malware campaign called "TraderTraitor" in the Harmony attack.

## Losses

The estimated value at the time of the attack was approximately $100 million USD.

## Security Failure Causes

**Insufficient System Security Measures:** The presence of the malware suggests that there may have been insufficient security measures in place to detect and prevent such attacks. This could include inadequate network monitoring, lack of intrusion detection systems, or insufficient measures to protect against advanced malware threats.
**Lack of Employee Awareness and Training:** Human error or lack of awareness among employees could have played a role in the security failure. Insufficient training or education on recognizing and responding to phishing attempts, social engineering, or other attack vectors may have made the organization more susceptible to the initial malware infiltration.
