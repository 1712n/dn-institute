## Summary

Cryptocurrency platform KyberSwap reported a cyberattack resulting in the theft of around $54.7 million worth of users' cryptocurrency. The attack occurred on Wednesday evening, involving complex actions to conduct exploitative swaps, enabling the withdrawal of funds into the attackers' [wallets.](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50275e0b7261559ce1644014d4b78d4aa63be836) In response, KyberSwap [paused](https://therecord.media/kyberswap-crypto-platform-54-million-hack) deposits, initiated an investigation, and began negotiations with the attackers to aid users in recovering their funds, offering a 10% bounty as an incentive. The platform emphasized the sophistication of the hack, requiring a precise on-chain sequence of actions. The company advised users to promptly withdraw their funds on Wednesday and acknowledged the challenge posed by the incident. The hacker posted a message on the [blockchain,](https://etherscan.io/idm?addresses=0x8180a5ca4e3b94045e05a9313777955f7518d757,0x50275e0b7261559ce1644014d4b78d4aa63be836&type=1) indicating negotiations would begin soon. This post connected to [wallet.](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50275e0b7261559ce1644014d4b78d4aa63be836) The attacker initiated an "infinite money glitch" on KyberSwap by [borrowing](https://cointelegraph.com/news/kyberswap-attacker-used-infinite-money-glitch-drain-funds-defi-expert) 10,000 wstETH ($23 million) through a flash loan from Aave. The attacker manipulated the token's price in the pool by dumping $6.7 million worth of tokens, causing a collapse in price. Exploiting a numerical peculiarity, the attacker strategically deposited and withdrew tokens, conducting multiple swaps. Despite the expectation that these swaps should cancel each other out, a protocol error allowed the attacker to double-count liquidity, ultimately yielding a profit of 2,859 wstETH ($6.7 million). The attacker replicated this exploit across various KyberSwap pools on different networks, accumulating a total of $46 million in crypto. KyberSwap had a failsafe mechanism in the computeSwapStep function designed to prevent the mentioned exploit. Despite this, the attacker successfully manipulated the numerical values involved in the swap, strategically keeping them just outside the range that would activate the failsafe mechanism.

## Attackers

The attacker has yet to be identified by law enforcement but has the public tag “KyberSwap Exploiter 1” on Etherscan. 

## Losses

KyberSwap has lost $54.7 million worth of USD.

   - KyberSwap, a decentralized finance platform, faced a significant security breach on November 22 when attackers exploited KyberSwap Elastic smart contracts. The attackers executed a series of complex actions, resulting in the exploitation of approximately $54.7 million of users' funds. In response, KyberSwap halted deposits, initiated an investigation, and engaged in negotiations with the attackers to facilitate the recovery of users' funds. The platform offered a 10% bounty as an incentive for the return of the exploited funds. The hack required precise on-chain actions by the attacker. Despite implementing various security measures, including internal smart contract checks, audits by security firms, and community developer reviews, KyberSwap faced this setback. The platform reassured users that its Aggregator API is functioning normally for partners, and the website is operational for trading activities and insights. The team expressed gratitude for the support received during the investigation and pledged to provide updates as the situation unfolds. KyberSwap is encouraging

## Security Failure Causes

The attacker manipulated the system to deceive the contract into perceiving a higher liquidity level than it actually possessed.
To mitigate these risks, developers should follow best practices, conduct thorough security audits, and stay informed about emerging security issues in the blockchain and smart contract space. Additionally, using established security tools and frameworks, as well as involving experienced security professionals, can contribute to building more secure smart contracts.
