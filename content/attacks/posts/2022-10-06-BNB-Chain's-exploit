---

## Summary

On October 6, 2022, the cross-chain bridge responsible for Binance Coin (BNB) ecosystem operation was hacked. The Attacker illegaly minted 2 million BNB, worth approximately $566 million. The Attacker then utilized various liquidity providers and lending protocols borrowing stablecoins and using previouly issued BNB as collateral. Although Binance did its best and froze most of the funds on BSC, hacker still managed to walk away with ~$137 million USD woth of crypto.

## Attackers

The Attackers remain completely unidentified. At least 16 burner wallets were used to operate the stolen funds.

## Losses

The hack resulted in an issue of 2 million BNB and, although vast majority of the funds was frozen in BSC thanks to a swift response from Binance, the Attacker ended up stealing approximately $137 million USD.

## Timeline

- **6:26 PM UTC**: the Attacker delivered the first 1 million BNB package to its own address.
- **6:30 PM UTC**: the first lending transaction of 600k BNB happened, resulting in 27.5m vBNB (~$250m).
- **6:36 PM UTC**: the second lending transaction of 300k BNB occurred, resulting in 13.7m vBNB (~$129m).
- **8:32 PM UTC**: the Attacker continued to make 15 failed attempts to deliver similar packages to its own address.
- **8:43 PM UTC**: the Attacker succeeded in delivering the last 1m BNB package to its own address.
- **9:30 PM UTC**: BSC announced that the chain would be halted due to “irregular activity”.


## Security Failure Causes

The exploit was executed trhough BSC Token Hub - a mediator between BEP2 and BEP20 that verifies proofs. The Attacker registered as a Relayer, a middleman responsible for submitting transactions between blockchains, and forged messages on a block height much lower than the legitimate withdrawals’ block heights and succeeded to withdraw 2 million BNB in two transaction. The BSC Token Hub exploit succeded due to underdeveloped security measuers of the bridge and BNB Beacon Chain as a whole. a temporary urgent patch - Moran Hardfork - was announced on October 12, intended to reinstate the architecture of the bridge.
