## Summary

Miner, an ERC-X avatar collection, faced a significant exploit on the Ethereum Mainnet on February 14, 2024, leading to a loss of 168.8 ETH, valued at around $466,000. The exploit was facilitated by a smart contract vulnerability related to a double-transfer issue, which arose from inadequate input validation. This allowed an exploiter to manipulate the transfer functionality, doubling their holdings by transferring tokens to themselves due to the contract failing to prevent self-transfers.

## Security Failure Causes

- **Smart Contract Vulnerability:** The core issue stemmed from a double-transfer vulnerability within Miner's smart contract, specifically due to insufficient input validation mechanisms. This flaw allowed tokens to be doubled by exploiting the contract's failure to restrict self-transfers.
