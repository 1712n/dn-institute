## Security Failure Causes

**Smart contract vulnerability:** The issue arises from errors in setting up wallet contracts due to a mismatch between their implementation and the corresponding proxy. During the initial setup, the proxy sets a value for the storage slot, and the wallet code accidentally overwrites it. This allowed the hacker to reinitialize the contract and steal the assets.
