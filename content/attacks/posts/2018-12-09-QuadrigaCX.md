## Summary

QuadrigaCX, once Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange, spiraled into controversy after its founder, Gerald Cotten, unexpectedly died in December 2018. The exchange announced it couldn't access C$250 million($190 million) in customer assets because Cotten had sole control of the private keys. Subsequent investigations, including one by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), revealed QuadrigaCX functioned akin to a Ponzi scheme, with fabricated trading volumes and misused customer funds.

## Early Indicators

- **Lack of Transparency:**  The absence of clear information about the company's operational procedures, particularly regarding the storage and handling of cryptocurrencies.
- **Centralized Control by the CEO:** The fact that only Gerald Cotten had access to the cold wallets and the passwords, leaving the company vulnerable in the event of his incapacity or death.
- **Unusual Withdrawal Processes:** The difficulties faced by customers when attempting to withdraw funds, and the use of third-party payment processors.
- **Legal and Financial Troubles:** The freezing of QuadrigaCX funds by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) due to uncertainties over the rightful ownership.
- **Questionable Founder Backgrounds:** Previous Involvement in High-risk Activities:  Coffounder Michael Patryn had a histories of involvement in high-yield investment programs (HYIPs), which are often associated with Ponzi schemes.
