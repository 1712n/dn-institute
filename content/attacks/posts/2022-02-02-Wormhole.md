## Summary

On February 3, 2022, Wormhole, a DeFi platform that helps move tokens and NFTs across different blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, etc.), was hacked. The attacker managed to bypass the Wormhole verification with a spoofed sysvar account to mint 120,000 wrapped ETH (wETH) tokens on the Solana network. [The invalid 93,750 wETH tokens were used to redeem them back into equivalent ETH tokens](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/320-million-wormhole-hack-explained-giap-nguyen/) on the Ethereum network. The rest of the invalid tokens were swapped for USDC and SOL tokens, as it was shown in the Certic incident analysis report. According to Forbes, [the attack caused a 10% drop in the value of the Solana cryptocurrency](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/02/03/crypto-price-alert-ethereum-rival-solana-suddenly-in-free-fall-after-huge-325-million-hack/?sh=3001422c4bb5) in the aftermath of the hack. But the worst-case scenario — a bank run and crash of wETH value — did not happen since Jump Trading, Wormhole’s parent company and a major player in the Solana ecosystem, stepped up and supplied Ether to replace what was stolen, after attempts to pay the hacker a $10 million bounty in return for the stolen funds were ignored.

## Attackers

The attackers remain unidentified. [The hacker's account: CxegPrfn2ge5dNiQberUrQJkHCcimeR4VXkeawcFBBka and wallet: 0x629e7Da20197a5429d30da36E77d06CdF796b71A](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/1kDYgyBcisoD2EqiBpHE5l-wormhole-bridge-exploit-incident-analysis).

## Losses

The attacker minted 120,000 wETH — a wrapped Ethereum equivalent on the Solana blockchain — which was equal to $325 million at the time of the theft, making it [the largest attack on Solana](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/blockchain-bridge-wormhole-loses-nearly-320-million-in-apparent-crypto-hack-12343952.htm). 

On 21st February 2023, Jump Crypto, the crypto arm of Jump Trading, in collaboration with Oasis, has [successfully recovered stolen funds](https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery) in a counter-exploit by [utilizing the Oasis contract and gaining control of the perpetrator's vaults](https://www.blockworksresearch.com/research/we-do-a-little-counter-exploit), resulting in a return of approximately $140 million. The intervention was made possible through a [court order received](https://blog.oasis.app/statement-regarding-the-transactions-from-the-oasis-multisig-on-21st-feb-2023/) by Oasis from the High Court of England and Wales, which mandated the retrieval of assets associated with the wallet address involved in the Wormhole exploit.

## Timeline:

- **February 2, 2022, 8:15 PM:** Soon after the attack, the Wormhole proposed the hacker a whitehat agreement with a $10 million bounty through the text in a transaction. The hacker didn’t make any contact.
- **February 3, 2022, 2:42 AM:** Wormhole announced "maintenance" in Twitter while investigating the exploit. 
- **February 3, 2022, 4:25 AM:** The Wormhole Twitter confirmed the breach and the amount stolen, which was 120k wETH.
- **February 3, 2022, 6:41 AM:** Wormhole twitted that the vulnerability has been patched.
- **February 21, 2023:** Jump Crypto, Wormhole’s parent company, retrieved $140 million via the counter-exploit of the perpetrator's vaults.

## Security Failure Causes

The cause of the hack was a bug in the signature verification code, which the intruder possibly [tracked by the commit in the Wormhole’s Github repository](https://extropy-io.medium.com/solanas-wormhole-hack-post-mortem-analysis-3b68b9e88e13). This program did not properly check if the signature verification was performed by a whitelisted address, and [the team did not have time to deploy the new version](https://extropy-io.medium.com/solanas-wormhole-hack-post-mortem-analysis-3b68b9e88e13) at the time of the attack. The attacker substituted the system address with their own program address, bypassing signature verification.
