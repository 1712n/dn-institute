title: "Wormhole Hack: Code Vulnerability Has Led to $325 Million Stolen"
loss: 325000000

## Summary

On February 3, 2022, a security breach occurred on Wormhole, a DeFi platform designed to facilitate the transfer of tokens and NFTs across various blockchains such as Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain. The attacker successfully exploited a vulnerability by utilizing a spoofed sysvar account, enabling them to mint 120,000 wrapped ETH (wETH) tokens on the Solana network. These tokens were later deemed invalid. Subsequently, [the attacker redeemed 93,750 wETH tokens for an equivalent value of ETH tokens](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/320-million-wormhole-hack-explained-giap-nguyen/) on the Ethereum network. Additionally, the remaining invalid tokens were exchanged for USDC and SOL tokens, as indicated in the Certic incident analysis report. As a result of the breach, the Solana cryptocurrency experienced a 10% decline in value, [according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/02/03/crypto-price-alert-ethereum-rival-solana-suddenly-in-free-fall-after-huge-325-million-hack/?sh=3001422c4bb5). Despite concerns of a potential collapse and devaluation of wETH, Jump Trading, the parent company of Wormhole and a significant participant in the Solana ecosystem, intervened by providing replacement Ether for the stolen funds. Notably, attempts to negotiate with the hacker by offering a $10 million bounty in exchange for the return of the stolen funds were unsuccessful.

## Attackers

The identities of the attackers involved in the incident remain unknown. [The hacker's account: CxegPrfn2ge5dNiQberUrQJkHCcimeR4VXkeawcFBBka and wallet: 0x629e7Da20197a5429d30da36E77d06CdF796b71A](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/1kDYgyBcisoD2EqiBpHE5l-wormhole-bridge-exploit-incident-analysis).

## Losses

The attacker orchestrated a significant theft by minting 120,000 wETH, which represented approximately $325 million in value at the time of the incident. This incident stands as [the largest attack ever witnessed on the Solana blockchain](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/blockchain-bridge-wormhole-loses-nearly-320-million-in-apparent-crypto-hack-12343952.htm).

On February 21, 2023, Jump Crypto, the cryptocurrency division of Jump Trading, joined forces with Oasis to [successfully recover a portion of the stolen funds](https://blockworks.co/news/jump-crypto-wormhole-hack-recovery). Through a counter-exploit strategy, they [leveraged the Oasis contract to gain control over the perpetrator's vaults](https://www.blockworksresearch.com/research/we-do-a-little-counter-exploit). As a result, approximately $140 million was retrieved. This remarkable intervention was made possible by obtaining a [court order from the High Court of England and Wales](https://blog.oasis.app/statement-regarding-the-transactions-from-the-oasis-multisig-on-21st-feb-2023/), which compelled Oasis to retrieve the assets associated with the wallet address involved in the Wormhole exploit.

## Timeline:

- **February 2, 2022, 8:15 PM:** Following the attack, Wormhole reached out to the hacker with a whitehat agreement, offering a $10 million bounty through a transaction message. However, the hacker did not respond.
- **February 3, 2022, 2:42 AM:** Wormhole announced on Twitter that they were undergoing "maintenance" while investigating the exploit.
- **February 3, 2022, 4:25 AM:** The official Wormhole Twitter account confirmed the security breach and the specific amount stolen, which totaled 120,000 wETH.
- **February 3, 2022, 6:41 AM:** In a subsequent tweet, Wormhole announced that the vulnerability had been patched, resolving the issue.
- **February 21, 2023:** Jump Crypto, the parent company of Wormhole, successfully retrieved $140 million through a counter-exploit, gaining control over the perpetrator's vaults.

## Security Failure Causes

The hack was attributed to a bug in the signature verification code, which the intruder potentially discovered by [examining the commit history in Wormhole's Github repository](https://extropy-io.medium.com/solanas-wormhole-hack-post-mortem-analysis-3b68b9e88e13). This flaw allowed the attacker to circumvent the signature verification process as it failed to properly validate whether the verification came from a whitelisted address. Unfortunately, [the team was unable to deploy the updated version in time](https://extropy-io.medium.com/solanas-wormhole-hack-post-mortem-analysis-3b68b9e88e13) to prevent the attack, enabling the attacker to substitute their own program address for the system address and bypass the signature verification mechanism.
