## Summary

On April 22, 2017, Yapizon, a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange,[suffered a security breach](https://www.newsbtc.com/news/south-korean-yapizon-bitcoin-exchange-confirms-hack-loses-5-mil-bitcoin/) in which hackers gained unauthorized access to the exchange's hot wallets, resulting in the theft of approximately $5.5 million worth of cryptocurrency. Later, after this incident, the exchange rebranded as Youbit.

## Attackers

[Lazarus Group](https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-bitcoin-exchange-yapizon-starts-trading-bitcoin-cash), a North Korean hacker crew has been accused of carrying out the heist. That was one of the first cryptocurrency-related hacks that Lazarus Group has been blamed for.

## Losses

The total losses are 3816 BTC, equivalent to around $5.5 million [(about 37% of Yapizon total assets)](https://mrhacker.co/news/south-korean-bitcoin-exchange-yapizon-hacked-5-million-stolen)].

## Timeline

- **April 22, 2017:** Yapizon [had funds drained from its hot wallets](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hacked-south-korean-bitcoin-exchange-loses-5-5-million/).
- **April 25, 2017:** Yapizon [announces the hack and decides to spread the losses to all user accounts](https://archive.is/97ZjO).
- **April 26, 2017:** Yapizon [has suspended operations for the next few days](https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2017/04/26/south-korean-bitcoin-exchange-yapizon-hacked-3831-btc/) in order to finish accounting work and strengthen security systems.


## Security Failure Causes

Yapizon has not officially announced what exactly allowed the hackers to access its system. Several possible reasons:

- **Insufficient Security Measures:**  Inadequate rencryption, weak access controls, and lax security protocols.
- **Attack on web infrastructure:** The attacker might have used web infrastructure vulnerabilities to get into the exchange's hot wallet services.
- **Social engineering attack:** Through a combination of phishing tactics, exploits, malware, and covert entry points, the culprits could have manipulated employees to get their private keys.
