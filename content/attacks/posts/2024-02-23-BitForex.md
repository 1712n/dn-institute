## Summary

Since February 23, 2024, BitForex, a crypto exchange operational since 2017, ceased processing withdrawals amidst unexplained outflows of about $56.5M worth of crypto from its hot wallets. The absence of communication from BitForex, coupled with the recent departure of its CEO Jason Luo, has raised concerns over a potential inside job or exit scam.

## Security Failure Causes

- **Inside Job:** The nature of the outflows, characterized by premeditated transactions and a significant delay in response from BitForex, suggests this may not be a straightforward hack. Initial transactions, such as a test transaction of 0.01 $ETH followed by a 58-hour inaction, indicate a controlled extraction of funds rather than a hurried hack.
