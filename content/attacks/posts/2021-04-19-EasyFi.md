## Security Failure Causes

- **Injection Vulnerability Exploitation:** The attacker injected a malicious version of MetaMask, showcasing a severe injection vulnerability which allowed unauthorized access to mnemonic/private keys to execute unauthorized transactions.
- **Insufficient Access Controls:** The machine compromised was dedicated to official transfers but was successfully accessed by the attacker, indicating inadequate access control measures.
- **Delayed Incident Response:** The machine's offline status at the time of attack delayed the response, enabling the attacker to drain substantial assets from the protocol, reflecting a need for enhanced incident detection and response strategies.
