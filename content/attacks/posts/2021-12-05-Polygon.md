title: "Polygon hacked for over 800,000 MATIC"
---

## Summary

In early December 2021, Polygon, an Ethereum-based network has "silently fixed" a vulnerability that had put its native MATIC tokens worth $24 billion at risk. The issue came to light after a group of ethical hackers informed Immunefi, a bug bounty platform associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). Immunefi hosts the bug bounty for the Polygon network. Both white hat hackers who helped discover the bug were compensated a combined total of $3.46 million as part of the bug bounty program. However, before the recommended upgrade, other hacker(s) were able to steal 801,601 MATIC tokens, making up for around $2.4 million in terms for the date of the hack.

## Attackers

The perpetrators remain unidentified. 

## Losses

The hacker carted away with 801,601 MATIC tokens before the vulnerability was fixed.

## Timeline

- **December 5, 2021:** Polygon found the vulnerability and proceeded to upgrade the mainnet. The mainnet upgrade was completed and the vulnerability was fixed.
- **December 29, 2021:** Project representatives confirmed the hacking incident through their blog and claimed that they had gotten the vulnerability under control through a concerted effort between the Polygon team, Immunefi, and two white hat hackers.

## Security Failure Causes

The main reason for the attack was a bug in the Polygon Plasma bridge, a two-way token gateway that allows users to transfer assets from the Polygon network to the Ethereum mainnet and back.
