title: "Polygon hacked for over 800,000 MATIC"
---

## Summary

In early December 2021, Polygon, an Ethereum-based network has "silently fixed" a vulnerability that had put its native MATIC tokens worth $24 billion at risk. The issue came to light after a group of ethical hackers informed Immunefi, a bug bounty platform associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). Immunefi hosts the bug bounty for the Polygon network. However, before the recommended upgrade, other hacker(s) were able to steal 801,601 MATIC tokens, making up for around $2.4 million in terms for the date of the hack.

## Attackers

The perpetrators remain unidentified. 

## Losses

The hacker carted away with 801,601 MATIC tokens before the vulnerability was fixed.

## Timeline

- **December 5, 2021:** Polygon found the vulnerability and proceeded to upgrade the mainnet. The mainnet upgrade was completed and the vulnerability was fixed.
- **December 29, 2021:** Project representatives confirmed the hacking incident through their blog and claimed that they had gotten the vulnerability under control through a concerted effort between the Polygon team, Immunefi, and two white hat hackers.

## Security Failure Causes

The main reason for the attack was a bug in the Polygon Plasma bridge, a two-way token gateway that allows users to transfer assets from the Polygon network to the Ethereum mainnet and back. 

## Additional Details 

- The bug was brought to its attention by two white hat hackers who shed light on the issue as part of the bug bounty program that Polygon had set up with partner Immunefi.
- Both white hat hackers who helped discover the bug were compensated a combined total of $3.46 million as part of the bug bounty program.
- Polygon has since patched the vulnerability that allowed the attack to take place.
