title: "FTX Collapse worsens after a $600 million hack"
---

## Summary

Early in November 2022, unidentified hackers stole more than $600 million from FTX's cryptocurrency wallets. Soon after, FTX announced that it had been compromised in its official Telegram channel, advising users to remove all FTX apps and not install any subsequent updates. Many FTX users reported having $0 in their FTX.com and FTX US wallets, according to Coindesk.com. A number of Ethereum tokens, Solana and Binance Smart Chain tokens, and other cryptocurrencies were transferred from FTX's official wallets to decentralized exchanges like 1inch. Both the US version of FTX US and the international version of FTX.com were impacted by the breach. The "transfers" took place on the day that FTX officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after allegedly losing billions of dollars in customer payments. The FTX's top executives have not formally acknowledged the transfers.

## Attackers

The attackers remain unknown. The cryptocurrency community, however, believes that FTX personnel could be the source of the attackers' well-planned and sophisticated attacks.

## Losses

A total of $477 million worth of cryptocurrency was allegedly taken from FTX, [according](https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/477-million-in-unauthorized-transfers-from-ftx/) to a blockchain analytics company named Elliptic. Various digital coins have been converted using the stolen funds, but the majority of them—more than $280 million—were changed into the cryptocurrency ether, according to publicly available blockchain data from the account connected to the hackers. Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CNBC that the hackers were changing ether into a cryptocurrency called RenBTC, which was subsequently converted into bitcoin using a bridge. Without using a centralized exchange, this enables the conversion of one cryptocurrency into another.

## Timeline

- **November 11, 2022, 11:52 PM UTC:** An administrator for the exchange's Telegram page posted a message acknowledging the hacking incident and cautioning users against using FTX apps, claiming that they were malware at the moment.
- **November 12, 2022, around 04:00 AM UTC:** FTX's login page went down (even though the website was still accessible), and anyone who attempted to log in received a 503 error. A 503 error occurs when the server is unavailable, usually because it is being serviced or is not accessible.
- **November 12, 2022:** FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller tweeted that the crypto exchange was making every effort to secure all assets, wherever located. He also claimed that the company was routing the remaining funds into cold storage.
- **November 14, 2022:** Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, announced the creation of an industry recovery fund to lessen the cascading adverse impacts of FTX and aid projects that are facing a liquidity crisis but have a strong foundation and structure for surviving it.
- **November 17, 2022:** The Securities Commission of the Bahamas revealed that it had requested the transfer of all of FTX Digital Markets' digital assets to a digital wallet under its jurisdiction for safekeeping purposes.

## Security Failure Causes

Users of both exchanges reported having no balances in their accounts, suggesting that both FTX and FTX US were hit by what is thought to be the outcome of a Trojan. There are [reports](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/ftx-hacked-1bn-drained-from-ftx-and-ftx-us-accounts-so-far/) that FTX sent emails and SMS messages to consumers encouraging them to log into the app and website, both of which were compromised by a trojan and used to facilitate the attack.
