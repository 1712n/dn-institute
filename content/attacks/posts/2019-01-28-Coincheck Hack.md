title: Coincheck Hack: $530 Million Worth of NEM Stolen
---

## Summary

In January 2019, Coincheck, one of Japan's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, experienced a major security breach resulting in the theft of approximately $530 million worth of NEM tokens. The attack stands as one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange hacks in history, highlighting the vulnerabilities faced by centralized exchanges and the urgent need for robust security measures in the crypto ecosystem.

## Attackers

According to the BIG Blockchain Intelligence Group Inc., some of the stolen NEM were traced back to a Canadian exchange and a Japanese exchange named Zaif. The NEM development team created an automated tagging system to ensure that all funds stolen from Coincheck are traced. By tagging stolen funds as tainted funds, cryptocurrency exchanges can now easily verify if stolen NEM funds are withdrawn or deposited to regulated trading platforms. As of now, the hackers behind the Coincheck NEM security breach are out of options. It is not possible for the hackers to convert the stolen NEM to other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum because the automated tagging system will immediately alert exchanges about the tainted funds

The Tokyo police said they had arrested two men for allegedly hacking cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck. The platform was hacked, and about $400 million of "NEM" tokens were stolen in January 2018, which is considered one of the largest hacking operations of cryptocurrency exchanges. The police have been pursuing the perpetrators ever since, and they believe they have now made progress in the case. According to media reports, investigators focused on tracking an alleged sale made on the dark web in which a large amount of "NEM" was traded at a 15% discount. Tokyo police believe hackers were able to exchange their XEM funds for Bitcoin. 
On March 11, 2022, two men were taken into custody. The details about the detainees are limited, but they are males, one from Osaka Prefecture and the other from Hokkaido. The Osaka resident is accused of transacting 24 million NEM coins and may have gained access to about 200 accounts. The two were arrested under the provisions of the Punishment of Organized Crimes and Proceeds of Crime Control Act.


## Losses

The attack resulted in the theft of 523 million NEM tokens, worth approximately $530 million at the time. The stolen funds belonged to Coincheck's users, comprising a mix of individual traders and institutional investors. The incident had a significant impact on Coincheck's reputation and raised concerns about the security practices of cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Timeline

- **January 26, 2019:** Coincheck detected an unauthorized outflow of NEM tokens from their hot wallet, prompting an immediate investigation into the security breach.
- Coincheck promptly suspended all withdrawals and deposits of NEM tokens and other cryptocurrencies as a precautionary measure.
- **January 27, 2019:** Coincheck confirmed the security breach in a public statement, acknowledging the significant loss of NEM tokens and promising to compensate affected users.
- Authorities and regulatory bodies initiated investigations into the incident, focusing on identifying the attackers and recovering the stolen funds.

- **March 12, 2019:** Coincheck completed the reimbursement process, compensating affected users with Japanese yen for their lost NEM tokens.

## Security Failure Causes

The Coincheck hack was facilitated by several security failures within the exchange's infrastructure. These included inadequate measures to secure the hot wallet, insufficient multi-signature authentication protocols, and insufficient risk management practices. The incident highlighted the crucial need for robust security controls and comprehensive risk assessments in cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Lessons Learned

The Coincheck hack served as a wake-up call for the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the importance of robust security practices. Key lessons learned from the incident include:

1. Enhanced Security Measures: Cryptocurrency exchanges must prioritize implementing robust security measures, such as multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and rigorous access controls. Regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing protection.

2. Regulatory Compliance: Cryptocurrency exchanges should adhere to regulatory guidelines and implement necessary measures to protect user funds and ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Collaborating with regulatory bodies helps establish industry standards and builds trust among users.

3. Transparent Communication: Prompt and transparent communication with affected users is crucial during security incidents. Keeping users informed about the breach, recovery efforts, and compensation plans helps maintain trust and demonstrates a commitment to user protection.

4. Insurance Coverage: Cryptocurrency exchanges should consider obtaining insurance coverage to protect user funds in the event of a security breach. Insurance can provide an additional layer of financial protection for both the exchange and its users.

5. Continuous Improvement: Security practices in the cryptocurrency industry must continually evolve to stay ahead of emerging threats. Cryptocurrency exchanges should regularly update and improve their security protocols, conduct thorough risk assessments, and foster a culture of security awareness among their employees and users.
