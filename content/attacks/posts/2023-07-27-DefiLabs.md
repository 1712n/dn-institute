## Summary

## Early Indicators

- **Lack of Transparency:** Despite promising security and stability, DeFiLabs did not provide comprehensive details about its team, and operational procedures. The absence of such information can indicate an attempt to avoid scrutiny and accountability.
- **Centralization Risks in Smart Contract:** [Certik audit](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/defilabs) points to contract centralization. While DeFiLabs was audited, the crucial vPoolv6 contract containing the backdoor was not reviewed.
