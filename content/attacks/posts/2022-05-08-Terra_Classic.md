title: The Collapse of Terra Classic Network Resulting in a $40 Billion Loss
---

## Summary

The $40 billion Terra Classic Network experienced an implosion triggered by a complex interplay of market dynamics and key events. Central to the Terra Luna Network were its two native coins, $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was an algorithmic Stablecoin meant to maintain a $1 peg, with $LUNC acting as a satellite asset absorbing $USTC's volatility through a mint and burn functionality and inherent arbitrage opportunities. However, the withdrawal of a substantial amount of $USTC from the Curve3pool by the Luna Foundation Guard, in preparation for the new Curve4pool, set off a bank run. Consequently, a handful of whales also withdrew large sums from the anchor protocol, causing $USTC to devalue on exchanges, leading to an uncontrollable minting of $LUNC tokens and a rapid fall in its valuation. The network further faced transaction overload due to market panic, leading to large scale liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol. The CEO of Terra Classic, Do Kwon, was later arrested on charges of various forms of fraud.

## Attackers

While not traditional attackers, the following whale addresses were instrumental in triggering the crisis:

## Losses

The Terra Classic Network incurred a loss of $40 billion, primarily due to the massive devaluation of $USTC and $LUNC.

## Timeline:

- **May 7, 2023:** An 85 million UST swap for 84.5 million USDC was detected, signifying potential capital flight from UST. UST's value drops to $0.985 after large dumps on Terra's Anchor and Curve. [Source](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/08/ust-briefly-loses-peg-luna-drops-10/)

## Security Failure Causes

The crisis was the result of a combination of factors: poor decision-making by the Luna Foundation Guard (the decision to withdraw 250 million $USTC from Curve3pool), significant withdrawals by whales from the anchor protocol, an imbalance between $USTC and other stablecoins in the pool, a firesale of $USTC resulting in uncontrollable minting of $LUNC, and network overload. The systemic failure to predict and manage these risks led to the implosion of the Terra Classic Network.
