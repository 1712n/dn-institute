loss: 160000000
---

## Summary

On September 20, 2022, Wintermute, a London-based algorithmic market maker offering liquidity across Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) deals, was the victim of a security breach. The exploit resulted in a loss of approximately $160 million, impacting 90 different assets including stable coins, Bitcoin, Ether, and various altcoins. The attack was executed through a brute force private key compromise [Source](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-profanity-address-generator-hack-september-2022). The suspected vulnerability originated from Profanity, a service Wintermute used for generating vanity addresses, despite efforts to blacklist their Profanity-associated accounts after the vulnerability became known.

## Attackers

The identity of the attackers remains unknown. As of June 22, 2023, the Ethereum address linked to the attacker and currently holding all stolen funds is:

- [0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705).

A smart contract implicated in the attack:

- [0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26)

## Losses

The total losses amounted to roughly $160 million. This consisted of around $120 million in stable coins (USDC and USDT), $20 million in Bitcoin and Ether, and another $20 million spread across various altcoins.

## Security Failure Causes

**Profanity's Vulnerability:** An inherent weakness in Profanity's code allowed the attacker to generate all potential keys for a vanity address by bruteforcing the private keys, scan associated accounts, and then steal the funds.

> More details on the hackers process, since the toolâ€™s security bug enabled cracking private keys of addresses, specifically someone could brute-force private keys of every 7-character vanity address using roughly a thousand GPUs for 50 days.

**Human Error:** Despite Wintermute's efforts to blacklist their Profanity accounts upon learning of the vulnerability, a human error resulted in one account not being blacklisted, thus remaining exposed and likely leading to the significant theft.
