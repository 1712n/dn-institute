title: AurumCoin Users Face Losses in a 51% Attack
---

## Summary

In November 2018, AurumCoin (AU), a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, was hit by a 51% attack. During the attack, an anonymous entity was able to gain control of a majority of the network's hash rate, which enabled them to alter the blockchain ledger and perform double-spend transactions. The attack resulted in the loss of 15,752.26 AurumCoins from the Cryptopia exchange, which was valued at approximately $500,000 at the time.

## Attackers

The attackers behind the 51% attack on AurumCoin remain unidentified. They were able to accumulate a majority of the network’s hash power, thereby taking control of the AurumCoin blockchain. This control enabled them to alter the blockchain ledger to their advantage and execute double-spend transactions.

## Losses

The attack led to the double-spending of 15,752.26 AurumCoins, which were withdrawn from the Cryptopia exchange. At the time, these AurumCoins were valued at approximately $500,000. The loss had a significant impact on the AurumCoin community and raised questions about the security measures in place.

## Timeline

- **November 2018:** AurumCoin network experiences a sudden increase in hash rate, indicating an attempted takeover of the network.
- **November 2018:** The 51% attack occurs as the anonymous attacker gains control over the majority of the network’s hash rate, which enables them to alter the blockchain ledger and execute double-spend transactions.
- **November 2018:** Cryptopia exchange reports a loss of 15,752.26 AurumCoins valued at approximately $500,000 due to the attack.
- **Following Days:** The cryptocurrency community discusses the implications of the attack, with many raising concerns regarding the security of smaller cryptocurrencies like AurumCoin.

## Security Failure Causes

- **Centralization of hash power:** One of the main factors that contributed to the attack was the centralization of hash power. The attackers were able to gain control over a majority of the network’s hash rate, which enabled them to alter the blockchain ledger.
- **Smaller network:** As AurumCoin was a smaller cryptocurrency with a lower hash rate compared to larger networks, it was relatively easier and less costly for an attacker to gain the hash power needed for a 51% attack.
- **Lack of security measures:** AurumCoin did not have sufficient security measures in place to protect against or mitigate the effects of a 51% attack.
