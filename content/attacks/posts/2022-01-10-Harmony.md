title: Harmony suffers 51% attack, blockchain halted
---

## Summary

On October 1, 2022, Harmony, a layer-1 blockchain, suffered a 51% attack. The attack resulted in the reorganization of over 100 blocks and the double-spend of $100 million worth of ONE tokens. The attack was possible because of a vulnerability in the Harmony blockchain's consensus mechanism. This vulnerability allowed the hackers to reorganize blocks and reverse transactions.

## Attackers

The attack was carried out by a group of hackers who rented mining power from a number of different mining pools. This allowed the hackers to coordinate their attacks and gain control of over 50% of the network's hashrate.

## Losses

The 51% attack on Harmony resulted in the double-spend of $100 million worth of ONE tokens. The attackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in the blockchain's consensus mechanism to reorganize blocks and reverse transactions.

## Timeline

- **October 1, 2022:**  Harmony announces that it has suffered a 51% attack. The blockchain is halted to prevent further damage.
- **October 2, 2022:**  Harmony resumes operations after the network is patched. The stolen funds are not recovered.

## Security Failure Causes

The main reason for the 51% attack on Harmony was a vulnerability in the blockchain's consensus mechanism. The vulnerability allowed the attackers to rent mining power and gain control of over 51% of the network's hashrate.

Harmony has since patched the vulnerability and taken steps to improve the security of the network. However, the attack has highlighted the risks associated with Proof-of-Work blockchains.

## Additional Details 

- The attack was carried out by a group of hackers who rented mining power from a number of different mining pools.
- The hackers were able to reorganize over 100 blocks, which allowed them to double-spend $100 million worth of ONE tokens.
- Harmony has since patched the vulnerability that allowed the attack to take place.
- The attack has highlighted the risks associated with Proof-of-Work blockchains.
