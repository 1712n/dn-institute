## Summary

On July 19, 2017, Parity Technologies fell victim to a wallet hack. A vulnerability was discovered and [exploited in the Parity MultiSig Wallet version 1.5+](https://blog.aeternity.com/parity-multisig-wallet-hack-47cc507d964d), enabling the attacker to take control over the contracts and drain all their funds. The attack resulted in a loss of 153,037 ETH, equivalent to approximately $34 million from three ([one](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91efffb9c6cd3a66474688d0a48aa6ecfe515aa5), [two](https://etherscan.io/address/0x50126e8fcb9be29f83c6bbd913cc85b40eaf86fc), and [three](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbec591de75b8699a3ba52f073428822d0bfc0d7e)) wallets.

- **July 18, 2017 10:33:23 PM UTC:** The attacker executed a [second transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e0d16475d2ac6a4802437a35a21776e5c9b681a77fef1693b0badbb6afdb083) to transfer funds to his wallet.

- **July 19, 2017:** OpenZeppelin [published a report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7), asserting that their MultiSig Wallet is not impacted by the mentioned vulnerability.
- **July 20, 2017:** Parity Technologies [published a post-mortem](https://www.parity.io/blog/the-multi-sig-hack-a-postmortem), mentioning that they had disabled the faulty code.

## Security Failure Causes

**Poor Coding Practices:** The flaw was found in the "initWallet" function of the Parity Multisig Wallet, which can change the contract's owners. It lacked checks to prevent an attacker from calling it after the contract was initialized.

**Delegated Call Use:** The use of delegatecall as a catch-all forwarding mechanism contributed to the vulnerability. This made all public functions from the library callable by anyone, including the 'initWallet' function.
