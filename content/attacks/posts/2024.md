title: "Theta Vault Exploited with Flash Loan Attack Leading to a Loss of $47 Million"
loss: 47000000

---

## Summary

On April 15, 2023, Theta Vault, a decentralized options platform, suffered a devastating flash loan attack, resulting in a loss of approximately $47 million in various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and USD Tether (USDT). The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Theta Vault's options pricing mechanism, particularly in its volatility calculation algorithm.

The attacker used multiple Ethereum addresses to carry out the attack, manipulating the volatility metrics to artificially inflate the value of their options. They utilized a flash loan to borrow a large amount of ETH from the Aave protocol, temporarily inflating the trading volume and volatility. This allowed them to sell options at an inflated price, then repay the flash loan, and pocket the profit.

Theta Vault promptly disabled the affected contracts and sought help from blockchain security firms to track the stolen funds. They also appealed to the attacker to return the funds, offering a 10% bounty for any cooperation.

## Security Failure Causes

**Options pricing vulnerability:** A flaw in Theta Vault's options pricing mechanism, specifically within its volatility calculation algorithm, allowed the attacker to manipulate prices and execute the exploit.

**Flash loan misuse:** The attack leveraged the power of flash loans to temporarily inflate trading volume and volatility, which was not adequately protected against in Theta Vault's system.
