## Security Failure Causes

Several reasons according to [Neptune Mutual](https://neptunemutual.com/blog/taking-a-closer-look-at-dforce-exploit) report:

- **Team's Negligence:** The attack was made possible by a [known reentrancy vulnerability](https://chainsecurity.com/curve-lp-oracle-manipulation-post-mortem/) that was not addressed during the audit conducted by dForce.
- **Reliance on External Functions:** The reentrancy attack exploited the dependence on external view functions, which reported incorrect state values when reentered.
- **Absence of Reentrancy Locks:** The absence of reentrancy locks in the smart contract facilitated the attack. These locks could prevent multiple invocations of a contract function within the same call chain.
