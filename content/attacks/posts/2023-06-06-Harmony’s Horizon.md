title: Harmony's Horizon Bridge was the victim of a massive cyberattack from North Korea
---

## Summary

On Thursday, June 23, 2022, the Harmony Protocol team was notified of a malicious attack on their proprietary Horizon Bridge. Blockchain bridges, also known as cross-chain bridges, facilitate communication between different blockchain networks and allow users to transfer assets from one network to another. Using Harmony's Horizon Bridge, users can move assets, including tokens, stablecoins, and NFTs, between the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Harmony blockchains.
At 5:30 AM Pacific Standard Time, several transactions compromised the bridge, with 11 transactions extracting tokens stored in the bridge. The hackers were able to steal the following assets: Frax (FRAX), Wrapped Ether (WETH), Aave (AAVE), Sushi (SUSHI), Frax Share (FXS), AAG (AAG), Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), Tether (USDT), Wrapped BTC (WBTC), and USD Coin (USDC). Some of these tokens have been exchanged for ETH on decentralized exchanges.

## Attackers

On January 23, 2023, the FBI announced that the North Korean organizations Lazarus Group and APT38 were responsible for the invasion. On January 13th, the hackers made an attempt to transfer 41,000 ETH ($63.5 million) via Railgun before distributing the funds across multiple addresses in three cryptocurrency exchanges. Approximately 350 of these addresses have been identified as being directly controlled by the Lazarus group.
Nevertheless, a portion of the funds was frozen and recovered by exchanges when the hackers tried to convert them into Bitcoin. The remaining unrecovered funds were then transferred to 11 Ethereum addresses.
According to the announcement, the FBI and its investigative partners will continue to identify and disrupt North Korea's theft and laundering of virtual currency, which is used to support North Korea's ballistic missile and Weapons of Mass Destruction programs.

## Losses

The estimated value at the time of the attack was approximately $100 million USD.

## Security Failure Causes

Harmony did not disclose how the funds were stolen. However, in April 2022, the founder of Chainstride Capital, known as "@_apedev", expressed concerns about the security of Harmony's Horizon bridge. The researcher warned on Twitter that the security of the Horizon bridge relied on a multisignature wallet, which required only two signatures to initiate transactions. Multisignature wallets require the consent of multiple parties to ensure additional transaction security.
