title: "LeetSwap Exploit: A $624,000 Loss on Base Chain"
loss: 624000
---

## Summary

LeetSwap, a DEX and DeFi ecosystem on the Base chain, experienced a significant exploit on August 1, 2023, leading to a loss of approximately $624,000. The vulnerability was rooted in a smart contract function intended to transfer tokens for fee collection, which was mistakenly made public, allowing unrestricted external access. The attacker leveraged this oversight to manipulate token prices by transferring tokens in a way that impacted the market, executing a series of trades that drained 340 ETH from various pools.
