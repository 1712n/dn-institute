title: Ronin Network suffers 51% attack, $625 million stolen
---

## Summary

On March 23, 2022, Ronin Network, a blockchain that powers the popular game Axie Infinity, suffered a 51% attack. This allows the attacker to control the network and perform malicious actions, such as double-spending transactions or preventing new blocks from being mined. The attack resulted in the theft of $625 million worth of Ethereum and USDC.

## Attackers 

The attackers behind the 51% attack remain unidentified. However, it is believed that the attackers used a backdoor that was created by a third-party contractor to gain access to the Ronin Network's systems.

## Losses

The 51% attack on Ronin Network resulted in the theft of $625 million worth of Ethereum and USDC. The attackers were able to exploit a vulnerability in the blockchain's consensus mechanism to reorganize blocks and reverse transactions.

## Timeline

- **March 23, 2022:** Ronin Network announces that it has suffered a 51% attack. The blockchain is halted to prevent further damage.
- **March 29, 2022:** Ronin Network resumes operations after the network is patched. The stolen funds are not recovered.

## Security Failure Causes

The main reason for the 51% attack on Ronin Network was a vulnerability in the blockchain's consensus mechanism. The vulnerability allowed the attackers to rent mining power and gain control of over 50% of the network's hashrate.

Ronin Network has since patched the vulnerability and taken steps to improve the security of the network. However, the attack has highlighted the risks associated with Proof-of-Work blockchains.

## Additional Details 

- The attack was carried out by a group of hackers who rented mining power from a number of different mining pools.
- The hackers were able to reorganize over 100 blocks, which allowed them to double-spend $625 million worth of ETH and USDC.
- Ronin Network has since patched the vulnerability that allowed the attack to take place.
- The attack has highlighted the risks associated with Proof-of-Work blockchains.
