title: "Lendhub Hacked for $6 Million"
---

## Summary:

A hacker exploited a vulnerability in the LendHub protocol to steal approximately $6 million in digital assets. The vulnerability was caused by the existence of two IBSV tokens on the platform, one of which had been deprecated but not removed. The attacker was able to mint and redeem tokens in the old market while borrowing against them in the new market, ultimately making off with the majority of the assets on the platform.

## Attackers:

The attackers behind the Lendhub hack remain unidentified.

## Losses:

Lendhub lost approximately $6 million.

## Timeline:

- **February 26, 2023:**  The attacker has deposited another 2,415.4 $ETH into Tornado.cash

## Security Failure Causes:

The main reason for the Lendhub attack was the failure to remove a deprecated token from the market properly. This vulnerability allowed attackers to exploit the protocol's smart contracts and steal funds.
