## Summary

In November 2018, AurumCoin (AU), a relatively lesser-known cryptocurrency, was hit by a 51% attack. During the attack, an anonymous entity was able to gain control of a majority of the network's hash rate, which enabled them to alter the blockchain ledger and perform double-spend transactions. The attack resulted in the loss of 15,752.26 AurumCoins from the Cryptopia exchange, which was valued at approximately $500,000 at the time.

## Attackers

The attackers remain unidentified.

## Losses

The attack led to the double-spending of 15,752.26 AurumCoins, which were withdrawn from the Cryptopia exchange. At the time, these AurumCoins were valued at approximately $500,000.

## Timeline

- **November 2018:** The 51% attack occurs as the anonymous attacker gains control over the majority of the network’s hash rate, which enables them to alter the blockchain ledger and execute double-spend transactions.
- **November 2018:** Cryptopia exchange reports a loss of 15,752.26 AurumCoins valued at approximately $500,000 due to the attack.

## Security Failure Causes

- **Centralization of hash power:** One of the main factors that contributed to the attack was the centralization of hash power. The attackers were able to gain control over a majority of the network’s hash rate, which enabled them to alter the blockchain ledger.
- **Smaller network:** As AurumCoin was a smaller cryptocurrency with a lower hash rate compared to larger networks, it was relatively easier and less costly for an attacker to gain the hash power needed for a 51% attack.
- **Lack of security measures:** AurumCoin did not have sufficient security measures in place to protect against or mitigate the effects of a 51% attack.
