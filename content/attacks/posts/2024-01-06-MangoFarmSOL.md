loss: 1320000
---

## Summary

MangoFarmSOL promoted itself as a lucrative farming solution on the Solana blockchain, leveraging promises of high returns and significant MANGO token airdrops. To engage, users were required to contribute Solana tokens.

However, the MangoFarmSOL team initiated an exit scam by transferring 13,512 SOL tokens (~$1.26 million) from the projectâ€™s contract containing user deposits. Subsequently, a malicious interface under the guise of an emergency migration was introduced, which stole an additional $60,000 from users. In the aftermath, MangoFarmSOL erased its online presence, including its website and social media accounts.
