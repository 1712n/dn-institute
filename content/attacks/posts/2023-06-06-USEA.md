## Summary


On June 6, 2023, the USEA, a BEP20 token on the Binance Smart Chain, experienced a price collapse of 99% in value following an exit scam executed by its deployer. The deployer minted 867,000,000 $USEA tokens and subsequently withdrew all liquidity from its PancakeSwap trading pair, leading to a significant loss of $1.1 million for its users. The $USEA token lacked any official web presence or social media accounts, obscuring the project's legitimacy and facilitating the scam.
