---

## Summary

Krypton, an Ethereum-based blockchain, experienced a 51% attack in August 2016. The attackers were able to control more than half of the network's hash rate, enabling them to manipulate the blockchain and double-spend KR tokens.

## Attackers

The identity of the attackers remains unknown. 

## Losses

It was reported that the attackers managed to steal approximately 21,465 KR tokens, which had a value of about $3,000 at the time of the attack.

## Timeline

- **August 23, 2016:** The Krypton network experiences a sudden spike in its hash rate, and the 51% attack begins.
- **August 24, 2016:** The Krypton team becomes aware of the attack and starts to investigate the incident.

## Security Failure Causes

- **Lack of Decentralization:** Similar to other 51% attacks, the Krypton network suffered from a lack of decentralization in its mining power. This allowed the attackers to easily gain control over the network.
- **Low Network Hash Rate:** At the time, Krypton was a relatively small cryptocurrency, with a low network hash rate, making it an easy target for attackers.
- **Exploitation of Network Vulnerabilities:** The attackers exploited specific vulnerabilities in the Krypton network, which had not been sufficiently secured against potential 51% attacks.
