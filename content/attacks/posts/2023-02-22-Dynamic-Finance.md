title: "Dynamic Finance Suffers $22,400 Loss Due to Reentrancy Attack"
loss: 22400
---

## Summary

Dynamic Finance, a DeFi aggregator, was exploited for 73 BNB ($22,400) on February 22, 2023, via a reentrancy attack on its StakingDYNA contract. The attacker exploited insufficient reentrancy protections, tricking the platform's deposit tracking system. Initially, the attacker deposited a small amount of $DYNA, then significantly inflated their deposit amount through a flash loan. This allowed them to claim exaggerated rewards and withdraw them, exploiting the platformâ€™s reward calculation and withdrawal mechanisms. The attack resulted in financial loss and caused the $DYNA token price to crash by over 93%.
