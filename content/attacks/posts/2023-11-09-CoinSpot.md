title: Crypto Exchange CoinSpot Reportedly Suffers $2.4 Million Hot Wallet Hack
loss: 2400000

## Summary

On November 8, 2023, the Australian crypto exchange, CoinSpot, experienced an attack on two of its hot wallets, resulting in more than [$2.4 million](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/11/coinspot-reportedly-suffers-2m-private-key-exploit) in losses due to a private key leak. The recipient of these funds exchanged them using platforms THORchain and Wan Bridge before exchanging them for Bitcoin using Uniswap and spreading them into four wallets. The Australian financial authority, AUSTRAC, is actively addressing the security breach because the amount stolen is more than [$10,000.](https://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-11/AUSTRAC%20draft%20guidance%20-%20reporting%20multiple%20cash%20transactions_0.pdf)

## Security Failure Causes

 
The successful attack on CoinSpot, resulting in a $2 million theft, can be attributed to several fundamental security IT failures:

   - **Private Key Exploitation:** The attacker accessed CoinSpot's funds by exploiting vulnerabilities associated with the private key of a hot wallet.
   - **Lack of Effective Anomaly Detection:** The system failed to detect unauthorized transactions in real-time, allowing the theft to occur without immediate detection.
   - **Inadequate Asset Transfer Monitoring:** The stolen funds were quickly moved and laundered through multiple exchanges and converted to Bitcoin, indicating a lack of monitoring and control over asset transfers.
