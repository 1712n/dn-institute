loss: 3300000
---

## Summary

Raft R, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, suffered a $3.3 million exploit that resulted in a 50% drop in the value of its R stablecoin. The attacker drained 1,577 ETH from Raft, sent 1,570 ETH to a burn address, leaving only 7 ETH for themselves. The hacker likely lost money as the exploit cost them 4 ETH. Raft's stablecoin initially dropped to 50 cents but later rebounded to around 70 cents. The attacker minted R tokens, sold them to drain liquidity, and withdrew collateral. Raft is working to compensate users using protocol-owned sDAI in the Peg Stability Module.

## Security Failure Causes

The exploiter minted R (which was then sold to drain AMM liquidity), and also managed to withdraw collateral at the same time.
