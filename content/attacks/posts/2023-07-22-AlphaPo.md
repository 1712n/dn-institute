## Summary

AlphaPo, a crypto payment platform that processes payments for various gambling services, suffered a loss of more than $60 million due to a private key compromise that affected their hot wallets across Bitcoin, Tron, and Ethereum. The stolen funds were transferred to other blockchains, including Avalanche and Bitcoin. The funds on Bitcoin were deposited into the crypto mixer service Sinbad. The loss also includes the losses suffered by CoinsPaid, an entity related to AlphaPo.

## Security Failure Causes

**Private Key Compromise:** The attackers gained access to the private keys of AlphaPo's hot wallets. It's not clear how the private keys were compromised, but the resulting breach indicates a significant architectural and operational security oversight.
