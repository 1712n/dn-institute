## Security Failure Causes

The attackers were able to gain access to the stolen funds by unauthorized access of Kronos Research private keys due to the following security failure causes:

   - **Unauthorized Access through API Key Compromise:**
The sucessful attack resulted from the compromise of Kronos Research API keys, allowing unauthorized access to critical systems and resources.
   - **Weak API Key Security Practices:**
Weaknesses in the security practices surrounding Kronos Research's API keys, such as inadequate encryption or lack of proper access controls, provided an entry point for attackers.
   - **Insufficient Access Controls on API Endpoints:**
Inadequate access controls on API endpoints allowed the attackers to gain unauthorized access to the stolen funds.
   - **Lack of API Security Monitoring:**
The absence of effective monitoring on API activities and access attempts contributed to the success of the unauthorized access.
   - **Insufficient User Authentication for API Access:**
Weaknesses in user authentication mechanisms for API access may have allowed unauthorized entities to gain control of the stolen funds.
