| [Volume-volatility correlation](volume-volatility-correlation.md) | Trading volumes usually spike when volatility in markets rise. Normally, high values of this metric indicate healthy market behavior.                                                                                                                                 | `volume_volatility_correlation`                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Benford's Law](benfords-law.md)                 | The first significant digit distribution tends to fit Benford’s law for traditional financial markets and regulated exchanges. High deviation from this law may indicate potential anomalies, manipulation, or fraudulent activities in the market.                   | `first_digit_distribution`                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Volume distribution](volume-distribution.md)             | Use various statisitcal metrics to estimate the shape of the trading volume distribution and its covergence to the power law. | `volume_distribution`<br>`volume_distribution_kurtosis`<br>`volume_distribution_mean`<br>`volume_distribution_median`<br>`volumedistribution_mode`<br>`volume_distribution_mode`<br>`volume_distribution_skewness`<br>`volume_distribution_std` |
| [Time-of-trade](time-of-trade.md)                 | This indicator identifies abnormal accumulation of scheduled trades executed at the same time - minute/second.                                                                                                                                                        | `count_time_distribution`                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Buy/sell ratio](buy-sell-ratio.md)                | Depending on whether the order taker is a buyer or seller, each trade is associated with a specific side of the trade. A consistent and large number of trades on one side of the book is a pattern that may signal automated activity.                               | `buy_sell_count_ratio`                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
