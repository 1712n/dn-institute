| Volume-volatility correlation | Trading volumes usually spike when volatility in markets rise. Normally, high values of this metric indicate healthy market behavior.                                                                                                                                 | `volume_volatility_correlation`                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Benford's Law                 | The first significant digit distribution tends to fit Benfordâ€™s law for traditional financial markets and regulated exchanges. High deviation from this law may indicate potential anomalies, manipulation, or fraudulent activities in the market.                   | `first_digit_distribution`                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Volume distribution             | Use various statisitcal metrics to estimate the shape of the trading volume distribution and its covergence to the power law. | `volume_distribution`<br>`volume_distribution_kurtosis`<br>`volume_distribution_mean`<br>`volume_distribution_median`<br>`volumedistribution_mode`<br>`volume_distribution_mode`<br>`volume_distribution_skewness`<br>`volume_distribution_std` |
| Time-of-trade                 | This indicator identifies abnormal accumulation of scheduled trades executed at the same time - minute/second.                                                                                                                                                        | `count_time_distribution`                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Buy/sell ratio                | Depending on whether the order taker is a buyer or seller, each trade is associated with a specific side of the trade. A consistent and large number of trades on one side of the book is a pattern that may signal automated activity.                               | `buy_sell_count_ratio`                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| VWAP                          | Volume weighted average price                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `vwap`                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
