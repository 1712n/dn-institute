## General Description

The Volume-Volatility Correlation is a statistical measure that identifies the relationship between trading volume and market volatility in cryptocurrency exchanges. It assists in determining the health of the market and can highlight potential signs of market manipulation.

## Theory

Trading volumes generally increase when market volatility rises, signaling healthy market behavior. This phenomenon originates from the basic market principle that significant price movements, either upward or downward, tend to attract more trading activity. The Volume-Volatility Correlation metric quantifies this relationship, providing a numerical value to represent the correlation between volume and volatility.

## Mathematical Background

The mathematical computation for volume-volatility correlation can be conducted using Pearson's correlation coefficient formula. The result is a value between -1 and 1.

\rho(X,Y) = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}

Where:

- _ρ_(_X,Y_)is the Pearson correlation coefficient between X (Volume) and Y (Volatility)
- _cov_(X,Y) is the covariance between X and Y
- _σX_ and _σY_ are the standard deviations of X and Y respectively

## Crypto Context

In the world of cryptocurrency trading, the Volume-Volatility Correlation metric is essential for monitoring market behavior. This indicator was integrated into various Crypto Exchnage Benchmarking [reports](https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocompare-launches-exchange-benchmark-in-response-to-concerns-over-false-volume-reporting). According to the industry background, those exchanges that steadily show Volume-Volatility correlation less than 0.4 are considered as market venues with potentialled inflated volume. 

## Usage Examples

Consider the following data sample for the Volume-Volatility Correlation:

**Example Value: `0.72781`**

This moderate positive correlation value suggests normal market behavior, as trading volumes are moderately correlated with market volatility. Anomalies or potential manipulations may be suspected if this value were significantly lower or even negative.
