## General Description

VWAP, or Volume Weighted Average Price, is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price of a trading instrument based on both volume and price. The idea is simple: more weight is given to the price levels where a lot of trading activity has occurred, giving a more realistic average price that is less susceptible to manipulation.

## Crypto Context

In cryptocurrency markets, the VWAP can be used to understand the true average price of a coin, adjusted for volume. This is especially useful in these markets, which can be more volatile and less liquid compared to traditional financial markets.

## Usage Examples

Consider the API metric:

- `vwap`: An example value of `1624.164` is provided. This value represents the average price, adjusted for volume, at which trades have been executed over a defined period.

## How to Interpret

- A significant difference between the VWAP and the current execution price may indicate manipulation or that the price is moving in a particular direction. For instance, if the current price is much higher than the VWAP, it may be considered overvalued, as it has been trading at a price higher than the average volume-weighted price.
- Observing the Volume Weighted Average Price for a particular trading pair across various exchanges may assist in identifying notable price discrepancies and potentially capitalizing on arbitrage opportunities.

## Visuals

A line chart plotting the VWAP and the current price over time can provide a clear visual representation of price trends and potential anomalies. A consistent gap between the VWAP and the current price should be a red flag for traders and analysts.
