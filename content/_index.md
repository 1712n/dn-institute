## DNI Mission

Distributed Networks Institute (DNI) aims to help distributed networks achieve resilience and sustainable growth through standardization, documentation, and education. We are a part of a 501(c)3 non-profit incubator in Washington DC called [BlockShop](https://blockshop.org).

## Axes of research

{{< columns >}}
### Standardization

_adapting stricter security and transparency standards_

DNI pushes the industry to consolidate efforts on peer-reviewed technologies and their implementations. This work goes beyond the obvious network engineering and touches on proactive fraud prevention and compliance.

<--->

### Documentation

_threat reduction by focusing on things that matter_

We maintain a crowdsourced knowledge base on IT security vulnerabilities and hacker attack taxonomy across distributed networks. Our attack surface maps and corresponding datasets help regulators and law enforcement focus attention on the biggest threats and principal actors.

<--->

### Education

_thought leadership and popularization_

By publishing periodical articles, DNI contributes to combating the snake oil being sold through pseudo-scientific papers, talks, and lobbying. We also work with industry partners to develop and deliver educational programs that meet their specific needs.

## Projects

### Crowdsourced Attack Wiki

As part of our documentation efforts, we maintain a [crowdsourced knowledge base]({{< ref "attacks/posts" >}}) on all distributed network attacks. This wiki can be a valuable resource for IT security professionals, as well as a source of ground truth for threat modeling systems. [Feel free to contribute](https://github.com/1712n/dni-website/).

### Improving Oracles
Oracles are one of the pillars of modern distributed networks, allowing smart contracts to interact with the external world. We focus on [building models](https://github.com/1712n/yachay-public) capable of answering what, when, and where questions.

### MVT API

[Market Venue Transparency API]({{< ref "mvt" >}}) is our effort to bring accountability and transparency to the crypto market venues.
