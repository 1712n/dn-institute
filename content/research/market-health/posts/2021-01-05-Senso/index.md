One of the ways in which new projects can gain recognition and adoption from users is by rising in rank on sites like CoinMarketCap. Project teams will often solicit the services of [market makers who create fake activity on exchanges](https://youtu.be/I-Um62NPm0A?t=330) in order to boost the ranking of their token.

The diagram below reveals this commonly used trick to fabricate trade volume. Usually this sort of activity appears on the venue when there is one entity acting on both sides of the market - buying lower and selling higher of the same asset back and forth with themselves.
