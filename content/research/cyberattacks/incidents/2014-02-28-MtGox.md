title: Mt. Gox hacked, losing over $450 million worth of Bitcoin
loss: 450000000

## Summary

Between 2011 and 2014, Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, experienced a series of attacks that ultimately led to its downfall. A combination of transaction malleability attacks, poor security practices, and mismanagement resulted in the loss of approximately 850,000 BTC, valued at over $450 million at the time. As a consequence, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, and its CEO, Mark Karpeles, faced legal action.

## Attackers

The attacker behind the Mt. Gox hack remains unidentified, with theories suggesting an insider, a group of hackers, or a state-sponsored actor. The sophisticated nature of the attack, which exploited a vulnerability in the exchange's software, implies that the perpetrator may have had both inside knowledge and technical expertise.

### Money Laundering

It was reported that a Russian national named Alexander Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017 and accused of laundering at least $4 billion worth of funds, including some of the stolen bitcoins from the Mt. Gox hack, through a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange called BTC-e. Vinnik was indicted by a U.S. grand jury on multiple counts of money laundering and other related crimes.

## Losses

850,000 BTC was stolen, worth over $450 million at the time of the attack. While the exchange later recovered 200,000 of the stolen Bitcoins, the remaining 650,000 have never been found. In the years since the hack, Mt. Gox has been trying to repay its customers. However, the process has been slow and complicated. In 2018, a Japanese court approved a plan to repay customers with a combination of cash and Bitcoin. However, the repayment process is still ongoing, and it is not clear when all of the customers will be repaid.

## Security Failure Causes

These include transaction malleability attacks, inadequate cold storage practices, insufficient security measures, and mismanagement. The long-term effects of these issues culminated in the massive loss of Bitcoin and the eventual collapse of the exchange.
