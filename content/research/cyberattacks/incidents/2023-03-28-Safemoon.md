title: "SafeMoon's Smart Contract Exploit: An $8.9M Heist and Unexpected Return of Funds"
loss: 8900000
---

## Summary

In March 2023, SafeMoon, a DeFi protocol, experienced a significant security breach when a vulnerability in its contract allowed an attacker to steal approximately $8.9 million. The attacker exploited unprotected burn and mint functions, essentially manipulating the value of the SFM token. In a surprising turn of events, the attacker agreed to return 80% of the stolen funds, retaining the remaining 20% as a bug bounty.

## Attackers

The attacker's identity remains unknown. The following BSC addresses were involved in malicious actions:

- [0x286e09932b8d096cba3423d12965042736b8f850](https://bscscan.com/address/0x286e09932b8d096cba3423d12965042736b8f850)

## Losses

- 28k BNB (~$8.9 million)

## Timeline

- **March 28, 2023, 07:26:27 PM +UTC:** An attacker [exploits](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x48e52a12cb297354a2a1c54cbc897cf3772328e7e71f51c9889bb8c5e533a934) smart contract vulnerability. They burn a significant amount of SFM tokens from the SFM/BNB liquidity pool, which drastically increases the price of SFM tokens in the pool. They then sell previously acquired SFM tokens into this skewed pool, draining it of BNB liquidity and making a profit of 28k BNB or $8.9M.

They offer to return the funds.

## Security Failure Causes

- **Unprotected burn and mint functions:** The recent updates to the SafeMoon contract introduced burn and mint functions that were not properly protected. This allowed the attacker to manipulate the value of the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool.
- **Potential private key compromise:** The presence of such elementary errors in the contract updates [suggested](https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1640855857910149122) that there could have been a compromise of a private key, which may have allowed the malicious update.
