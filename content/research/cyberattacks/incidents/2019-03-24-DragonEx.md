- **March 25, 2022:** [DragonEx became aware of the hack and suspended withdrawals.](https://t.me/DragonEx_EN/50126)

## Security Failure Causes

- **Insufficient system security measures:** The organization may not have had enough security measures in place to detect and prevent malware attacks. This could include not monitoring the network enough, not having intrusion detection systems, or not having enough protection against advanced malware threats.
- **Lack of employee awareness and training:** Human error or lack of awareness among employees could have played a role in the security failure. Employees may not have been trained enough to recognize and respond to phishing attempts, social engineering, or other attack vectors. This could have made the organization more susceptible to the initial malware infiltration.
