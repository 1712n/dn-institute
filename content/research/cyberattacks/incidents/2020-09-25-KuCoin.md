## Summary

On September 26, 2020, KuCoin, a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange, [experienced a significant security breach](https://www.kucoin.com/ru/news/en-kucoin-security-incident-update), resulting in the theft of approximately $281 million worth of cryptocurrencies. [The hackers obtained the private keys to the exchange’s hot wallets](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/26/over-280m-drained-in-kucoin-crypto-exchange-hack/). The hackers sold the stolen cryptocurrency from their addresses on decentralized exchanges and anonymized the stolen cryptocurrencies through the mixing services. The incident caused a temporary drop in the price of KuCoin's exchange token KCS by 14%, to $0.86. However, by November 11, 2020, [KuCoin was able to recover all the stolen assets](https://cointelegraph.com/news/kucoin-ceo-says-insurance-covered-16-of-losses-from-285m-hack-in-2020), so users were unaffected by the hack: 84% were regained by on-chain tracking, contract upgrade and judicial recovery; the remaining 16% were covered by the KuCoin insurance funds.

## Security Failure Causes

On the official website, the KuCoin team explained that the hack was made because of a leakage of the private keys of KuCoin hot wallets. The leakage could became possible due to [several reasons](https://hacken.io/insights/kucoin-september-2020-hack-hacken-research/):

- Malicious actions of responsible employees: this could have been done by someone from the exchange staff who had the appropriate access.
- Attack on web infrastructure: the attacker could gain access to the exchange’s hot wallet services.
- Social engineering attack: the hackers could obtain access to private keys as a result of a phishing attack by using exploits, viruses, and backdoors on employees who had access to private keys.
