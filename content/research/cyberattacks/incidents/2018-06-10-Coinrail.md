## Security Failure Causes

**Weak operational security practices:** According to the local police, the hack happened due to a lack of efficient security protocols.

**Insider threat or social engineering:** [Networking experts believed](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/crypto-hacks-the-coinrail-hack-resulted-in-a-loss-of-over-40-million) that the breach was made successful by involuntary support from a machine inside the company that had admin-level access to the internal system.
