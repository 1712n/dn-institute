title: "BitForex's Exit Scam Leads to $56.5 Million in Financial Losses."
loss: 56500000

## Summary

Since February 23, 2024, BitForex, a crypto exchange operational since 2017, ceased processing withdrawals amidst unexplained outflows of about $56.5M worth of crypto from its hot wallets. The absence of communication from BitForex, coupled with the recent departure of its CEO Jason Luo, has raised concerns over a potential inside job or exit scam. 

## Attackers

The identity of the scammers is unknown, but the main suspect is the CEO of the exchange, Jason Luo. The nature of the outflows and a significant delay in response from BitForex, suggests this may not be a straightforward hack. Initial transactions, such as the test transaction of 0.01 $ETH, followed by 58-hour inactivity, indicate a controlled extraction of funds rather than a grab-and-run attack.

The following addresses are associated with the scam:

- Ethereum Wallet:
  - [0xdcacd7eb6692b816b6957f8898c1c4b63d1fc01f](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcacd7eb6692b816b6957f8898c1c4b63d1fc01f)
    
- Tron Wallet:
