## Summary

In January 2015, LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platform, experienced a security breach that resulted in the theft of 17 BTC (approximately $3,850 at the time). The breach was caused by a vulnerability in the platform's forum software, which allowed the attacker to gain access to user accounts. LocalBitcoins quickly responded to the incident by disabling the forum and reimbursing affected users.

The identity of the attacker remains unknown.

## Losses

17 BTC was stolen, which was worth approximately $3,850 at the time of the attack. LocalBitcoins covered the losses and reimbursed affected users.

## Timeline

- **Late December 2014 - Early January 2015:** The attacker starts probing LocalBitcoins' security systems and infrastructure, looking for vulnerabilities.
- **January 14, 2015:** The attacker identifies a vulnerability in the platform's Live Chat feature, allowing them to insert malicious code and carry out a phishing attack.
- **January 26, 2015:** The attackers initiate the phishing attack, sending messages with malicious links to LocalBitcoins users through the Live Chat feature. The phishing attack causes some users to unknowingly provide their login credentials, enabling the attackers to gain unauthorized access to their accounts.

- **February 2, 2015:** LocalBitcoins announces that the Live Chat vulnerability has been patched and the feature is re-enabled.

## Security Failure Causes

The security breach was caused by a vulnerability in the forum software used by LocalBitcoins. The attacker exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, which allowed them to steal 17 BTC. To mitigate future risks, LocalBitcoins disabled the forum, advised users to change their passwords, and urged them to enable two-factor authentication.
