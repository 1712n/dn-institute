title: "Steadefi Loses $1.14 Million to Deployer Address Compromise"
loss: 1140000

## Summary

Steadefi, a yield farming platform on Arbitrum and Avalanche, reported a loss of $1.14 million due to a compromised deployer address. The exploit allowed the attacker to assume control over the platform's vault contracts, leading to the unauthorized borrowing of all available funds. The total value locked (TVL) in Steadefi [dropped from over $2 million to almost $0 as a result](https://defillama.com/protocol/steadefi). The funds were converted to approximately 625 ETH and landed in Tornado Cash. In response, Steadefi issued an on-chain bounty plea, offering the exploiter to return 90% of the funds while keeping the rest as a bounty.
