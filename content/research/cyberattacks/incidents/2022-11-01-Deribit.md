## Security Failure Causes

- **Lack of multi-signature wallets:** Deribit's hot wallet was not protected by multi-signature security, which would have required multiple people to approve withdrawals. This made it easier for the attacker to gain access to the wallet and withdraw the funds.
- **Insufficient security measures:** [Deribit did not have sufficient security measures in place to protect its hot wallet](https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3an8N7IcFo3ESkV80fwQ38-deribit-incident-analysis). This included weak passwords and poor access control.
