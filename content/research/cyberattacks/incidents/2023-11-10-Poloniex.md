- **November 10, 2023, 04:04 PM UTC:** Justin Sun, majority shareholder of the exchange, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1723008641433784695) that part of the stolen funds was frozen.
- **November 10, 2023, 08:12 PM UTC:** A market researcher platform, X-explore, [posted an analysis of the hack](https://twitter.com/x_explore_eth/status/1723071043177468167), suspecting Lazarus Group in the breach due to similar attack behavior to the Stake.com incident.
- **November 15, 2023:** Poloniex [announced](https://support.poloniex.com/hc/en-us/articles/19080588734743) the resumption of deposit and withdrawal services.
- **November 18, 2023, 06:33 AM UTC:** Justin Sun [sent an on-chain message](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x87383693584db90e2b5c5fdb16d98f168b7a7005f32869275e6d477d5576ba0c) to the attacker with the following content:
    > We have already confirmed your identity, and the police forces of China, the USA, and Russia have been involved... Return by November 25, 2023, and we will offer a $10 million white hat reward.
- **November 20, 2023, 03:05 AM UTC:** A community member [noticed](https://twitter.com/billyp258/status/1726436594662437091) that the exchange wouldnâ€™t need to involve the police in three different countries and send the same message in 15 different languages if the hacker was already identified.

## Security Failure Causes

**Compromised Private Key:** The primary cause of the security breach was the compromise of the private key of Poloniex's hot wallets. The attacker exploited this vulnerability to withdraw funds from the hot wallets.

**Web Infrastructure Attack:** The simultaneous hack of multiple wallets in various chains points to a more extensive web infrastructure attack, possibly targeting vulnerabilities in the platform's security system.
