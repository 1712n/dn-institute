title: "The Collapse of Terra Classic Network Resulting in a $40 Billion Loss"
loss: 40000000000
---

## Summary

The Terra Classic Network, worth $40 billion, collapsed due to a mix of market factors and significant events. The network hinged on its two primary coins, $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC, an algorithmic Stablecoin, was designed to hold a steady value of $1. $LUNC was created to soak up $USTC's instability through minting and burning processes and built-in opportunities for arbitrage. Trouble began when the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew a large portion of $USTC from Curve3pool to make room for the new Curve4pool. This caused a bank run. As a result, several large investors also pulled out significant sums from the anchor protocol, which made $USTC lose value on trading platforms. This triggered an uncontrolled production of $LUNC tokens and a quick drop in its value. The network was then overwhelmed by transactions due to market panic, which led to mass liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol. Eventually, Terra Classic's CEO, Do Kwon, was arrested on various fraud charges.

## Losses

The Terra Classic Network incurred a loss of $40 billion, primarily due to the massive devaluation of $USTC and $LUNC.

## Security Failure Causes

**Poor Choices:** The Luna Foundation Guard's decision to withdraw 250 million $USTC from Curve3pool contributed to the crisis.

**Actions of Large Investors:** The crisis was also caused by large investors taking out a lot of money from the Anchor Protocol. This upset the balance of $USTC and other stablecoins in the pool, led to a quick sale of $USTC, and caused too many $LUNC coins to be made. The network couldn't handle all this, and the inability to predict and manage these risks caused the Terra Classic Network to collapse.
