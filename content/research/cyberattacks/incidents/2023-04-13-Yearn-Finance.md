## Security Failure Causes

- **Smart contract misconfiguration:** The root cause of the vulnerability was a [misconfiguration](https://twitter.com/yearnfi/status/1646436798086672385) in the yUSDT vault's smart contract. Specifically, the contract utilized the iUSDC token instead of the iUSDT token, leading to a mistaken dependency on the poolâ€™s underlying token. This error was present at the time of deployment and went unnoticed for approximately 1000 days.
