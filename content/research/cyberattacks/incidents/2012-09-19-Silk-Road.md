## Summary

[On September 19, 2012, James Zhong exploited the Silk Road dark web marketplace and was convicted of committing wire fraud](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction). The attacker managed to unlawfully obtain over 50,000 BTC by creating roughly nine accounts. Additionally, Zhong received 50,000 BitcoinCash(BCH) due to a hard fork coin split in August 2017, when every Bitcoin address also received an identical balance in BCH. Zhong managed to trigger over 140 transactions in rapid succession, fooling Silk Road’s withdrawal-processing system. Consequently, the funds were moved to separate addresses to prevent detection and obfuscate the source of the bitcoins. Zhong, using a decentralized Bitcoin mixer, frustrated tracing efforts and managed to conceal his fraudulent activities for nearly ten years. Law enforcement seized approximately 50,676 BTC from Zhong's residence, valued at over $3.36 billion, on November 9, 2021. This incident marked the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice as of July 6, 2023.

## Security Failure Causes

**Vulnerable Withdrawal-Processing System:** The security failure in Silk Road's withdrawal-processing system allowed Zhong to trick the platform via race condition exploitation into releasing approximately 50,000 Bitcoin.

**Insufficient Account Security:** Silk Road's account creation process allowed Zhong to register multiple accounts with only minimal information, facilitating his fraudulent activities.

**Lack of Advanced Fraud Detection Mechanisms:** Silk Road's failure to implement advanced fraud detection mechanisms resulted in Zhong's ability to execute over 140 transactions in rapid succession without triggering any alerts or suspensions.

**Bitcoin Anonymity:** The pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin enabled Zhong to initially hide his fraudulent activities and the source of the Bitcoin.
