title: "CoW Swap Suffers Smart Contract Exploit, Resulting in an Approximately $166K Loss"
loss: 166183
---

## Summary

On February 7, 2023, CoW Swap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, fell victim to a smart contract exploit, resulting in a loss of approximately 550 BNB, or about $180,000 USD. The breach occurred due to a flaw in the protocol's smart contract, which allowed an unidentified attacker to approve fund transfers from the protocol.

## Attackers

The identity of the attacker is unknown.

- **February 7, 2023:** Attackers [exploit](https://dune.com/queries/1543508) a vulnerability in the SwapGuard contract to transfer funds from the CoW Swap's settlement contract to their accounts.
- **February 7, 2023:** CoW Swap and Barter teams mitigate further damage by identifying the vulnerability, revoking all approvals for the vulnerable contract, and updating the Barter Solver contract.
- **February 8, 2023:** Barter Solver [refunds](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61a5196468b276bcedc3aab2f2fe255c2d54ca1c655523f4b25c99b1a224e715) the losses caused by the hack.

## Security Failure Causes

A couple of reasons, according to the CoW Swap [report](https://blog.cow.fi/cow-swap-solver-exploit-post-mortem-07-02-2023-2faa9f918e29):

- **Arbitrary Execution:** The SwapGuard contract, developed by the Barter Solver had a critical flaw. It allowed arbitrary execution of calls, a feature that the attackers exploited to drain tokens.
- **Unrestricted Approvals:** The Barter Solver approved the vulnerable SwapGuard contract with a maximum value of DAI, without adequately securing the contract against potential exploits.
