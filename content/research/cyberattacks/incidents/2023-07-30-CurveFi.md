## Summary:

On July 30, a hackers drained approximately $60 million from liquidity pools that decentralized exchanges uses to offer exchange of tokens. Affected protocols include CurveFi, MetronomeDAO, JPEGd and Alchemix.

Curve, as biggest funds lost from the breach, ranks among the most esteemed and reliable DEXes and relies on automated market makers in much the same way as Uniswap. Though it is still functioning, Curve has seen an exodus of funds since the hack.

## Losses

The attack drained $60 million in total from four projects. Detailed protocol-specific losses:

- **CurveFi**
  - $19,769,550 worth 10,560.14 ETH
  - $3,956,370 worth 7,193,401 CRV
- **Alchemix**
  - $13,663,900 worth 7,258.7 ETH
  - $9,076,167 worth 4,821.55 alETH
- **JPEGd**
  - $11,461,200 worth 6,106.65 ETH
- **MetronomeDAO**
  - $1,625,950 worth 866.55 ETH

Total Value Locked in the CurveFi slipped from $3.3 billion to $2.3 billion, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocol/curve-finance). Its governance token, CRV, [lost](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/) about 40% of its value in the weeks following the attack.

## Attackers:

The attack to the vulnerable pools came from several parties.

- [0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8) returned stolen funds to Alchemix, accompanied with an [onchain message](https://etherscan.io/idm?tx=0x23c4799784c91023204bd68a94ec7a963486f2485dc43c13d8b804d5301b8041) about not wanting to destroy the project.
- [c0ffeebabe.eth](https://twitter.com/coffeebabe_eth), an owner of MEV bot that frontran the attackers, returned much of the funds [to CurveFi](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb76754124fdde090f25129105ed2907e3c62e0db87ecb8ffcefcb1dede0954fd) and [to MetronomeDAO](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x650a73bfff233815ec6c4de22f105ddff8d5194d10b7375b3cdcd23ec6469f9a)
- [0x6ec21d1868743a44318c3c259a6d4953f9978538](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6ec21d1868743a44318c3c259a6d4953f9978538) returned most of the funds to the JPEGd protocol
- [0xb1c33b391c2569b737ec387e731e88589e8ec148](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1c33b391c2569b737ec387e731e88589e8ec148) holding $16 million as of August 27, 2023, which was stolen from the CurveFi.

## Security Failure Causes:

- **Vyper Compiler Bug:** Vyper, a compiler for the Ethereum Virtual Machine, contained a vulnerability in versions from 0.2.15 to 0.3.0 that did not properly lock up a smart contract with a Reentrancy Guard, which was intended to prevent the execution of a malicious sequence of functions at one transaction.
