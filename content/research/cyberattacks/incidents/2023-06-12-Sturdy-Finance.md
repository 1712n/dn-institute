## Security Failure Causes

- **Smart Contract Vulnerability**: The initial vulnerability that enabled the hack was a read-only reentrancy flaw within the smart contract system. This vulnerability allowed attackers to re-enter certain functions within the contract without proper access control or limitations, enabling them to exploit the contract's functions maliciously.
- **Flash Loans Exploitation:** The attackers initiated their scheme by obtaining a significant flash loan, a large amount of cryptocurrency borrowed and repaid within a single transaction. This loan provided the capital to manipulate market conditions in their favor without requiring any collateral, exploiting the protocol's mechanisms for borrowing and lending.
- **Price Oracle Manipulation**: Central to the attack was the manipulation of a faulty price oracle related to the Balancerâ€™s B-stETH-STABLE pool. By artificially inflating the price of the sBTC-WBTC liquidity provider tokens, the attackers deceived the protocol into misvaluing the collateral, allowing them to borrow against an inflated collateral value and subsequently extract profits by reversing the manipulation, thus exploiting the discrepancy between the manipulated and actual market values.
