Important news. Quoted tweet from @binance: Binance Security Breach Update binance.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/artic‚Ä¶ https://t.co/JZtMsbI9fS
Binance doesn't know the full extent of the hack, they know some 2FA has been compromised, they don't know which customer accounts are compromised, yet they enable trading. This is ballsy beyond belief.
#Binance hacked for 7000 BTC, a reported 2% of their total $BTC holdings. Deposits and withdraws are frozen and CZ promises to cover all loses from "#SAFU fund" Trading remains enabled, but deposits and withdraws frozen for 2 weeks, while they check their systems.
Next, a bit of laymen's terms analysis twitter.com/DoveyWan/statu‚Ä¶ Quoted tweet from @DoveyWan: Basically this is happened 1. hacker compromised individual accounts 2. Each can withdraw up to 1000 BTC 3. Binance has 7k BTC in the hot wallet 4.

IF YOU HAD AN ACCOUNT ON CRYPTOPIA WITH THE SAME EMAIL/PASS AS ANOTHER EXCHANGE GO CHANGE IT NOW
The latest news is that Cryptopia has been compromised. So kindly resume all your tradings by Cryptobridge until we have a definite word from Cryptopia.
Cryptopia's Colombo St headquarters was under police lock down on Wednesday morning after a "significant amount" of cryptocurrency is thought to have been transferred at the trader without authorisation
I seriously cant understand why you dont give us access to our accounts so we can secure our coins. Obviously Cryptopia has been compromised, whats to say more coins aren't being taken while the police are twiddling their thumbs trying to figure out what a block of chains is.
You can comment if a wallet is not impacted, not asking numbers. Was the BTC wallet impacted? Just yes or no is fine. Thanks.
I don't know if anyone mentioned it before but be sure to change all your PASSWORDS related to that Cryptopia e-mail in case they hacked the users database too. Better be safe than sorry.
Locking people out of their accounts so they cannot get transaction and login records to claim back any losses from exchange security breach or check what assets are missing if any seems like a legit action to take Thinking face
Most of my @Cryptopia_NZ shitcoins are gone now. This is why you should always store your coins in your own wallet, preferably in a hardware wallet!
The #WeAreSatoshi #WSX wallet has been untouched by Cryptopia's recent security breach. We are monitoring the development of the situation closely and will inform our community as soon as we know more information. We wish @Cryptopia_NZ the absolute best in this difficult time.
Cryptopia, one of the longest running #crypto exchanges has been hacked with the totality of losses unknown at this time. The only answer to these blatant security breaches is decentralized custody of assets.
#Cryptopia has announced that they have faced #security #breach, with rumours circulating that a large amount of #ERC20 assets have been lost. Which seem to be true when we look to their hot wallet;
Cryptopia joins the club of exchanges that were hacked (or perhaps "hacked") as it announced that it "suffered a security breach that resulted in significant losses." The exchange hacks currently total more than $1.1 billion

We advise you not to deposit anything in previously used Cryptopia addresses.
