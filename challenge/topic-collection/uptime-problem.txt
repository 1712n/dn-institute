Our Help Center and support forms are back up and running. Thank you for your patience!

Our highly experienced and extensive team are currently dedicated to getting the website back up as quickly as possible. We‚Äôre sorry to hear how much inconvenience this is causing you and appreciate your patience until we can provide further details.
Any tentative time, you are on maintenance since yesterday. I hope everything is ok.
Hey Cryptopia, I'm sure the community would appreciate significant details while we are eagerly awaiting for our withdraws to appear in wallets. It's now been more than 24h down with no explanation. Isn't that look a bit suspicious ?
Unscheduled.... probably got hacked and doing audit...?
Guys this is taking so long. please update us instead of replying with repeated messages.
7 hours since last update, could you please let everyone know if our funds are safe. This is really nerve wracking
Approaching 24hrs and still in the dark about what the root cause of the unscheduled maintenance is.  Please provide a detailed update!
23 hours and counting, this can not be maintenance
when will it be back up?
Maintenance without informing client!!! These are the way that scammers did
I wonder how long this will takes? since yesterday until now still you are not back online.
It has been more then 24 hours now since you guys are on maintenance... I hope and wish that everything is ok???? Please resume soon.
unscheduled maintenance is bad news for me after that btc-e maintenance... please come back soon cryptopia
down 24 hours now, and still no mention as to why.. not cool..  said you were going to post an update, when it came time for said update, there was no update, just a comment about still being down... what's going on?
We are currently experiencing an unscheduled maintenance, we are working to resume services as soon as possible. We will keep you updated.

I cringe when exchanges have unscheduled maintenance messages

While I (and others I'm sure) appreciate the reply - We are wondering what is going on. Any information on why you folks are down would be much appreciated
Kraken had a weird bug. Some of the commenters are upset, but cut @krakenfx some slack, because (1) bugs happen to everyone, and (2) far worse behaviors happen all the time, intentionally, on less reputable exchanges. Quoted tweet from @krakenfx: 1/3 Yesterday a test of an unreleased advanced order type encountered a bug which resulted in the order's prices being matched against the wrong side of the book. Some clients bought from the tester at $8000 and others sold at $12000 without clearing the intervening liquidity. https://t.co/iG3sEPCVXS

Incorrect fiat balance display on OKEx found around 19PM 22 May (Beijing Time). Withdrawal resumed on 23 May but soon suspended again. OKEx just announced further update at 13PM today.
This has to be one of the biggest scam exchanges out there!!! Always wallets in maintenance, tokens locked for months costing people $$$ piss poor cust svc!!! Wake up people and take your biz elsewhere!!!
They should be up again shortly. They have had about 200B in EMB withdrawals this week. Probably too high a volume for their system.
They have been going in and out of maintenance mode. They announced that they will honor any withdrawal requests made before the 21st even if they continue to have issues. They have done about 200B worth of EMB withdrawals so we are optimistic things will be up again soon.
We had a brief period of the BTC wallet in maintenance this morning. We can confirm that the wallet is now back to normal.
Does anyone wonder why bitcoin and all these other wallets are constantly under maintenance at crucial times?
No it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs back in maintenance again so I can‚Äôt withdraw. What‚Äôs going on?
It smells like a inside job. Hope you're so called scheduled maintenance will complete soon and my tokens will be there
Got this email days before the hack saying they were going in maintenance anyways 14th-18th because of the Constantinople Hard Fork.... This is an EXIT SCAMFace with look of triumph I want my god damn access to my account!!!!
If they were truly having an issue it would be once in a while! They have the same supposed issues all the time. I had coins locked for 45 days a year ago!! Always wallets and exchange under maintenance!!! They need to be investigated!
