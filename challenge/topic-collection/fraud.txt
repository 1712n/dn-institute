Exit scam
Can't believe so many ppl got scammed
It smells like a inside job. Hope you're so called scheduled maintenance will complete soon and my tokens will be there
Got this email days before the hack saying they were going in maintenance anyways 14th-18th because of the Constantinople Hard Fork.... This is an EXIT SCAMFace with look of triumph I want my god damn access to my account!!!!
it's now 24 hours with a series of 'holding' messages. Your customers deserve an immediate assurance that their funds are safe. It's time for your CEO to take some responsibility here. This is either a PR disaster or an exit scam - public perception is in your hands! Inform us.
Exit scam in progress
In house scam. Sorry to hear that happened to you
If they were truly having an issue it would be once in a while! They have the same supposed issues all the time. I had coins locked for 45 days a year ago!! Always wallets and exchange under maintenance!!! They need to be investigated!

Paul Sztorc retweeted: This is unbelievable. @BgogoExchange is running an IEO without the project's permission. But that's not the best part - Algorand (the project in question) won't launch for the next couple of months and there is no ERC20 token. So Bgogo is literally preselling an IOU. Dump 2.0
If you're a reporter covering the #QuadrigaCX case, please be cautious. Crowdsourced analyses are only as good as their input data. That data is inherently unreliable. Worse, if there's fraud involved, the people would actively try to pollute it.
Coinbase hints at the sensible explanation that has been going around about QuadrigaCX: 1. Multi million loss due to Ethereum address update 2. Attempt to trade out of hole with customer funds 3. Loss of funds during the bear market Quoted tweet from @brian_armstrong: Wanted to share a summary of what we believe happened to QuadrigaCX. We did our own internal research, including some blockchain analytics, to see if we could help. Important to note that this is just our best guess. Take it as *pure speculation*, nothing more.

Turns out that QuadrigaCX traded against its own users, and in the crypto world, this is seen as a totally normal thing that just happens at pretty much every exchange. buff.ly/2HmpEwe
These are good starting points, but far from everything wrong with QuadrigaCX. In time, we'll find out more about how the exchange laundered money, and which well-known people they worked with to do just that. buff.ly/2SRMQ7N

Peter Todd retweeted: @sabotagebeats @CryptoBacon @La__Cuen Liquid is far too centralized to risk putting a fraud token on it; ERC20 is better for that as ETH is much more decentralized. (this is a serious answer)
@adam3us @lucas_lclc @sabotagebeats @CryptoBacon @La__Cuen Right,glad we agree on what the tech does. I would not want to risk a fraud token to that, as I doubt fanout growing would stop a judge from issuing an order to blacklist outputs. Just too easy when the Liquid signers are a known set.
Meanwhile, there was a coordinated pump on the few remaining exchanges that support fraudcoin. If any of you still have some fraudcoin left around, these pumps are good opportunities to liquidate.
BrendanEich retweeted: @SchalkDormehl @RyanSAdams The theory that liquid derivative markets help smart contrary players bet against the fraud to balance it out did not help. Burry, Bass, others did great but were too few to stop the juggernaut, which definitely captured regulators & politicians. I know of no automated solution.

I am not really trying to cast blame, here. Just pointing out an observation. The incentive structures around ETH strongly encourage this sort of behavior, and this will continue to be the case at least until the ICO bubble pops. Quoted tweet from @eric_lombrozo: As a Bitcoin minimalist, do I want Ethereum to fail? No, I really was hoping it would succeed. Unfortunately, ever since the DAO, the Ethereum ecosystem has brought far more innovations in scammery than in distributed systems. It is a sad truth.

You can comment if a wallet is not impacted, not asking numbers. Was the BTC wallet impacted? Just yes or no is fine. Thanks.
