[TRANSITION UPDATE] We are getting ready to transfer funds from the old platform to the NEW NiceHash platform. Please note that withdrawals will be temporarily disabled during this process.
@Atheneumchain any ideas whats going on with @Cryptopia_NZ? wont even let you withdraw. no open buy or sell orders , just doesnt let you take out??
@Cryptopia_NZ has processed about 200B in EMB withdrawals this week so we are confident they will get around to everyoneâ€™s in time. They announced that all withdrawal requests will be honored if they are initiated before the 21st.
@Cryptopia_NZ hey fellas.. This issue with @tokenpay deposits and withdrawals is getting out of hand. As a community we have deemed you as the best place to purchase TPAY but yet you seem to have consistent issues.  We cannot fathom the reasoning.
@Cryptopia_NZ I also have the same issue  for more than a month now and no response to tickets raised and comment on the ticket ....when can we get this issue sorted out ?
@Cryptopia_NZ Seem to be noticing a number of transactions still under processing for the @TheGCCcoin ,we are quite close to the date for #Airdrop, try fix them or get in touch with us to find out a possible fix... there doesn't seen to be a problem with other exchanges/blockchain
@Cryptopia_NZ still holding my tron Exploding head itâ€™s been more than 72 hours since withdrawal was initiated
@Cryptopia_NZ you will release embercoin's withdrawal before deleting from the site
@stakecube just continues to impress. For #EMB holders with pending @Cryptopia_NZ withdrawals, StakeCube has stated that when your deposit comes through they will swap manually for you and credit your account with some freshly minted #AEM! 
@XCashCrypto Can you get Cryptopia to fix the withdraw issue ?
#Binance hacked for 7000 BTC, a reported 2% of their total $BTC holdings. Deposits and withdraws are frozen and CZ promises to cover all loses from "#SAFU fund" Trading remains enabled, but deposits and withdraws frozen for 2 weeks, while they check their systems.

Adam Back retweeted: #Binance is happy to announce a 50% reduction in $BTC withdrawal fees. Effective immediately, BTC withdrawal fees are only 0.0005 BTC!
And Bitcoin Cash? You said that the customers will have time to withdraw the BCH before the fork, I made the withdraw, it has not processed or broadcasted and until today the wallet under maintenance, with pending transaction, more than month, no answers by support, no feedback.
and many more, stay in maintance with months, hold our money #cryptopia @Cryptopia_NZ #scammers #ScamAlert #cryptocurrency

Centralized TTP that freezes user accounts complains about centralized TTP that freezes functionality on their token. Quoted tweet from @eosnewyork: Hey @binance, we are getting a lot of questions about why you are not enabling withdrawals for #EOS. Can you help us provide an answer? Thank you!
CRYPTOPIA WALLET IS CURRENTLY WORKING! Please withdraw your funds immediately. They have processed another 10B so please be patient.
Cryptopia_NZ has kept mine on pending all day

Does anyone wonder why bitcoin and all these other wallets are constantly under maintenance at crucial times?
Due to a potential 51% attack, ETC wallets have been disabled and will not be re-enabled until tomorrow (at the very earliest). We will update this thread when we have a firmer timeline for re-enabling deposits and withdrawals. Poloniex was not affected, and your fund are safe.

Good bye crytopia, I'm done with you! you can keep all my batcoins!
Got an email from @Poloniex saying they will be cancelling US traders? BTW, they still owe my friend money after cancelling the $PPC wallet before he could withdraw.
Having withdraw problems as well. So many #cryptopia PoW coins got double spent. The adult coins like $SXC & $TIT are being withdrawn at a first come first serve basis as cryptopia doesnâ€™t have everyoneâ€™s coins anymore.
Hey Cryptopia, I'm sure the community would appreciate significant details while we are eagerly awaiting for our withdraws to appear in wallets. It's now been more than 24h down with no explanation. Isn't that look a bit suspicious ?
I also have the same problem with withdrawl stuck for 20 days and no response to tickets raised. when will this be fixed please?
I am no expert, especially considering I held GCC all the way down, all the way back up and still now.  So, if itâ€™s on Cryptopia, do I have to do anything or will they give me the CTX if I just hold it there?  Thx
I can't Withdraw btc, it's progressing
I feel this dragging on now, just cancel the transaction and sent the TRX back to my Cryptopia wallet for me to re-send.
I'm still waiting for a my Bitcoin Cash, there is no feedback, there is no support for this situation and you are just gambling with these situations, since you've got hacked, you are taking advantages of this situation. My withdraw has not broadcasted by you, no support, nothing
I'm still waiting for mine too! They should be shut down!
I'm still waiting for my BCH. This is how you treat your customers, who bought, paid, negotiate at your platform and receive this kind of treatment.
If they were truly having an issue it would be once in a while! They have the same supposed issues all the time. I had coins locked for 45 days a year ago!! Always wallets and exchange under maintenance!!! They need to be investigated!
Incorrect fiat balance display on OKEx found around 19PM 22 May (Beijing Time). Withdrawal resumed on 23 May but soon suspended again. OKEx just announced further update at 13PM today.
Kyle Torpey retweeted: Hearing multiple reports that @binance is blocking withdrawals without notice and forcing KYC to unlock them. Not great. Be aware. cc:@cz_binance
Managed to get the withdrawal process going, just sitting at unconfirmed now. How long should it normally take?
My 2 two withdraw still on process, almost 1 week
My withdrawal is stuck in processing 3days now . K made support tickets already and there is no response. Please help
No it isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s back in maintenance again so I canâ€™t withdraw. Whatâ€™s going on?
Only 69 Cryptopia wallets in maintenance to fix right now. Totally not fractional reserve. Totally solvent. Totally not "Empty Gox". @Cryptopia_NZ give a PLAUSIBLE explanation to your customers if you want to keep them.
Os procesing more than 1 week
Please just fix the $frost wallet itâ€™s been in maintenance for months
Ryan Selkis retweeted: When you hear @binance is hacked so you run to get your holdings but they arenâ€™t allowing withdrawals but then the market goes up the market goes up 15%. #crypto https://t.co/0hwJN97ZIn
Shitty @coinbase article. Are QuadrigaCX customers unable to withdraw fiat or BTC? The article doesn't make that clear, and there's a *huge* difference between those two problems.
So why is 808 coin stiill in maintenance for almost a month now? Would like to be able to withdraw my coins.
Thatâ€™s funny because I have tickets for withdrawals stuck in processing for 3 weeks now and canâ€™t even get an update on those

The transaction in cryptopia has the status of completed, while in the explorer the transaction is not shown and the deposit has not been validated. I have sent from an external wallet to the address 
They have been going in and out of maintenance mode. They announced that they will honor any withdrawal requests made before the 21st even if they continue to have issues. They have done about 200B worth of EMB withdrawals so we are optimistic things will be up again soon.
They should be up again shortly. They have had about 200B in EMB withdrawals this week. Probably too high a volume for their system.
This has to be one of the biggest scam exchanges out there!!! Always wallets in maintenance, tokens locked for months costing people $$$ piss poor cust svc!!! Wake up people and take your biz elsewhere!!!
To all exchanges and mining pools please allow a significantly higher confirmation time on withdrawals and deposits (+400) cc @OKEx @ExchangeXGroup @HuobiGroup @digifinex @binance @bitfinex Quoted tweet from @eth_classic: There have been rumors of a possible chain reorganization or double spend attack.

Transactions on @Cryptopia_NZ have been broken for more than 2 months.  What good is a coin if you can't get it off of exchanges?
Turns out the funds were not so "safu" Quoted tweet from @cz_binance: Have to perform some unscheduled server maintenance that will impact deposits and withdrawals for a couple hours. No need to FUD. Funds are #safu.

Waiting for NZD deposits and withdrawal to open again,  such a loss
We had a brief period of the BTC wallet in maintenance this morning. We can confirm that the wallet is now back to normal.
When pac deposit/withdrawal cryptopia back online?
Why after delist emb ,daxx coin withdraw paused? Fake exchange Don't trust @ Cryptopia_NZ
Yes. Cryptopia just reopened withdrawals so let him know itâ€™s a good idea to withdraw ASAP.
