# Developement Documentation

## Content Organization 

### Sections

`attacks`, `mvt` and `oracles` are the main content sections.

### Mappings

`attack-types`, `entity-types` and `target-entities` don't hold content and provide data for the respective taxonomies mapped under `attacks/posts`. Similarly `entities` is a taxonomy mappped under `market-health`.

## Navigation

Use page params `navShowPages`, `navShowTaxonomies` and `navShowTerms` to configure how sections should appear on the navigation menu. Set `true` to show and `false` to hide.
