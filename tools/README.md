# Repo Tools

The scripts are invoked when commenting on a pull request. It only runs if the comment contains a command and the comment author is listed in the `WIKI_REVIEWERS` secret. Only the line containing the command will be interpreted so the comment can have multiple lines and normal content.

## Payout Calculation

`/payout`

User parameters are:

- `--rate` (`-r`)
- `--multiplier` (`-x`)

_e.g._ `/payout -r 1 -x 2`

## Quality Check

`/articlecheck`

It is a python script that takes command-line arguments with API keys and a link to a GitHub pull request. The script then extracts the diff from the pull request and sends it to an AI service with a prompt. The response from the AI service is converted by the script into JSON, and then based on this JSON, a comment is created for the pull request. Everything works in the GitHub Actions environment.

- Now it uses a model "claude-2" with retriever functions.

## Duplication Check

`/duplecheck`

Checks if the article from the pull request is new to Crypto Wiki. Uses GPT-3 for comparing two texts.
