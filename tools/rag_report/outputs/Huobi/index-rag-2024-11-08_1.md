## Summary

1. Recent data analysis reveals a concerning surge in manipulative practices and liquidity issues within Huobi's trading volume since June 2023.
2. **Trade Size Analysis:** The initial signs of abnormal activity were detected through increased transaction sizes, indicating the presence of volume-generating trading algorithms.
3. **Token Manipulation:** Huobi's founder tokens (HT, TRX) exhibited inflated trade volumes and prices due to transaction size adjustments, suggesting potential manipulation.
4. **Wash Trading Criteria:** Synchronized fluctuations in volume distribution skewness and fitting estimates across multiple spot markets (COMP, SOL, LINK, SUI, DOGE) indicate potential wash trading.
5. **Retail Transaction Clustering:** The absence of retail transaction clustering on Huobi highlights the lack of genuine retail presence, further supporting the artificial trading volume hypothesis.
6. **Potential Market Manipulation:** The order book analysis of Huobi's native token (HT) reveals suspicious patterns, emphasizing the need for user caution and potential regulatory intervention.

## Metrics used

### Abnormal activity indicator - Average transaction size

Transaction size is a critical parameter for understanding market dynamics. Spikes in average transaction size, coupled with low standard deviation values, are strong indicators of artificial trading activity. In Huobi's case, this was observed in tokens like DOGE, HT, SOL, and SUI.

### Order printing bots - Volume distribution tail and skewness

Volume distribution should ideally follow a power law heavy tail distribution. A tail exponent less than 3 is expected in traditional markets. However, Huobi's data shows deviations from this pattern, with volume distribution skewness below zero, indicating potential manipulation by trading bots.

### Real users presence - Spotting round-size trades

Recent research suggests that Huobi's reported volumes may not reflect genuine user activity. The retail clustering indicator, which compares the frequency of round volumes with other trade sizes, shows extremely low values for Huobi, indicating a lack of real users.

### Huobi Token - Unveiling controlled price dynamics

Huobi's native token, HT, exhibits abnormal buy-sell ratio stability, suggesting potential manipulation. This, coupled with Huobi's access to user order data, raises concerns about market manipulation and its impact on users.

## Regulatory Concerns and Similar Incidents

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently charged Binance, one of the largest crypto asset trading platforms, and its affiliates with securities law violations. The SEC's complaint highlights the manipulation of trading volumes and the use of wash trading practices, echoing the concerns observed in Huobi's case.

Additionally, the SEC has charged several individuals and companies, including ZM Quant, Gotbit, and CLS Global, with providing market-manipulation-as-a-service to crypto asset promoters. These promoters hired market makers to generate artificial trading volume and manipulate prices, targeting retail investors with false promises of profits.

The SEC's ongoing investigations into market manipulation in the crypto asset industry emphasize the need for increased regulatory scrutiny and user awareness. As the market for crypto assets is susceptible to manipulation, investors should exercise caution and be mindful of potential risks.
