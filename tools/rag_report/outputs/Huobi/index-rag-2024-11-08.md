## Summary

1. **Recent data analysis** reveals a concerning surge in manipulative practices and liquidity issues within Huobi's trading volume since June 2023. This analysis uncovers a range of suspicious activities, including wash trading, price manipulation, and the use of trading bots.
2. **Trade Size Analysis:** There has been an increase in activity from volume-generating trading algorithms, which is a red flag for potential liquidity issues and exchange solvency concerns.
3. **Token Manipulation:** Huobi's founder and exchange-linked tokens, HT and TRX, have been subject to manipulation. This has resulted in inflated trade volumes and token prices through transaction size adjustments, a tactic often employed by market manipulators.
4. **Wash Trading Criteria:** Synchronized fluctuations in volume distribution skewness and fitting estimates have been observed across multiple spot markets, including COMP, SOL, LINK, SUI, and DOGE. This pattern is indicative of wash trading, where market participants engage in self-trading to artificially inflate trading volume.
5. **Retail Transaction Clustering:** The absence of retail transaction clustering on Huobi is a significant indicator of artificial trading volume. This suggests that the exchange's reported volumes are not backed by genuine retail trading activity, raising concerns about the exchange's integrity.
6. **Potential Market Manipulation:** A closer look at Huobi's order book reveals potential manipulation of its native token, HT. This is evidenced by abnormal buy-sell ratio stability, which deviates from the expected random behavior seen on other exchanges like Gate.io and Poloniex.

## Metrics used

### Abnormal activity indicator - Average transaction size

The average transaction size is a critical metric for identifying abnormal trading activity. In a healthy market, this metric exhibits inherent volatility, with occasional spikes and dips. However, the analysis of Huobi's spot markets reveals a different pattern.

{{< figure src="tx-size-sui.png" alt="sui-usdt volume metrics" caption="Average transaction size, volume, and trade count on multiple Huobi spot market over time, June - July 2023" >}}

The low standard deviation values and substantial fluctuations in average transaction size across multiple Huobi spot markets strongly suggest dominant artificial trading activity in tokens like DOGE, HT, SOL, and SUI. This is further supported by the comparison with other exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, where the average transaction size for DOGE/USDT exhibits a more stable pattern.

### Order printing bots - Volume distribution tail and skewness

Volume distribution analysis provides additional insights into potential market manipulation. In a typical market, trading volume should follow a power law heavy tail distribution, with small trades being more common than large trades.

{{< figure src="sol-distribution-binance-huobi.png" alt="sol-usdt distribution comparison" caption="Trade volume distribution samples comparison, COMP and SOL tokens on Huobi and Binance, July 2023" loading="lazy" >}}

The tail exponent, which measures the distribution's heavy tail, is expected to be less than 3 in traditional financial markets. However, the analysis of Huobi's HT/USDT spot market reveals a different picture.

While the tail exponent should not be viewed in isolation, it does highlight the presence of individual traders placing high-volume orders and trading bots executing trades of identical sizes. This is further supported by the comparison with Binance, where the tail exponent for COMP and SOL tokens exhibits a more expected pattern.

Skewness, another important metric, measures the asymmetry of the volume distribution. In traditional markets, skewness is expected to be greater than 1, indicating more small-size trades. However, Huobi's data shows below-zero skewness values, which is a strong indicator of volume manipulation practices.

### Real users presence - Spotting round-size trades

Recent research and SEC complaints highlight the potential for wash trading and manipulation on Huobi. One way to detect the presence of real retail users is by analyzing round-size trades. Retail investors often use round values for trading, and the frequency of these trades can indicate genuine user activity.

{{< figure src="sui-clustering-test-huobi-coinbase.png" alt="clustering student test with 100x rounding" caption="Student's clustering test for 100x rounding, sui-usdt spot market, comparison between Huobi and Coinbase, July 2023" loading="lazy" >}}

The retail clustering indicator, which compares the frequency of round volumes with other trade sizes, shows extremely low values for Huobi. This suggests a lack of real users and further supports the hypothesis of artificial trading volume.

### Huobi Token - Unveiling Huobi's controlled price dynamics

Huobi's native token, HT, is a key focus of this analysis. Exchanges often manipulate their affiliated tokens to boost their image and attract customers. The buy-sell volume ratio is a critical metric in understanding price behavior.

{{< figure src="ht-usdt-buy-sell-volume-multiple-exchange-comparison.jpg" alt="ht-usdt buy/sell volume ratio comparison" caption="Buy/sell ratio of Huobi Token on Huobi, Poloniex and Gate.io, May - July 2023" loading="lazy" >}}

In a normal market, this ratio is volatile and appears random, as seen on Gate.io. However, Huobi Token's buy-sell ratio exhibits abnormal stability, fluctuating within a narrow range. This suggests potential manipulation, as Huobi may be attempting to control token price movements. The fact that Huobi possesses user order data further raises concerns about market manipulation, as it can use this data to influence trading activity.

## Implications and Concerns

The findings of this analysis have significant implications for the cryptocurrency market and its participants. The SEC's ongoing investigation into market manipulation in the crypto asset industry highlights the seriousness of these issues.

- **Retail Investors at Risk:** As Sanjay Wadhwa, Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, warns, retail investors are being victimized by fraudulent activity by institutional actors in the crypto markets. The schemes uncovered in this analysis, including wash trading and price manipulation, directly impact retail investors, who may be lured into these markets with false promises of profits.
- **Market Integrity:** The lack of transparency and the presence of related-party transactions on exchanges like Huobi undermine market integrity. The use of trading bots and algorithms to generate artificial trading volume distorts market signals and can lead to significant losses for unsuspecting investors.
- **Regulatory Action:** The SEC's actions against market manipulators, such as ZM Quant, Gotbit, and CLS Global, send a strong message to the industry. The SEC's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit (CACU) is committed to rooting out instances of misconduct, particularly when it involves securities.
- **Investor Education:** Investors need to be mindful of the risks associated with the crypto markets. The SEC's complaints against BAM Trading and BAM Management for misleading investors about market surveillance and controls on the Binance.US platform serve as a reminder of the importance of due diligence and caution.

In conclusion, the surge in manipulative practices and liquidity issues on Huobi is a cause for concern. The analysis presented here highlights the need for increased regulatory oversight, investor education, and market transparency to protect retail investors and maintain the integrity of the cryptocurrency market.
