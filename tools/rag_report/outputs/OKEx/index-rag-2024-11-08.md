Distinct surges in time-of-trade graphs on OKEx's Monero (XMR) and ZCash (ZEC) markets in 2020 indicate potential scheduled trading bot activity and wash trading. These patterns are particularly notable as many exchanges have delisted privacy coins due to regulatory concerns.

The XMR and ZEC second-of-trade graphs exhibited abnormal distributions, with the most active trading occurring every 5 seconds. This is unusual and may suggest a coordinated effort to manipulate the market or obfuscate illegal transactions. The liquidity of these markets was not a factor in the observed trading patterns.

Privacy coins have gained attention due to their anonymity features, which can facilitate illicit activities on darknet markets. The SEC has expressed concerns about the ease of market manipulation in the crypto space, as evidenced by their recent charges against Binance, BAM Trading, and their founder, Changpeng Zhao, for various securities law violations.

In the case of OKEx's XMR and ZEC markets, the SEC's concerns are particularly relevant. The abnormal trading patterns could be indicative of market manipulation schemes, similar to those allegedly employed by ZM Quant, Gotbit, and CLS Global, who were accused of wash trading and generating artificial trading volume on behalf of crypto asset promoters.

The SEC's Acting Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Crypto Asset and Cyber Unit, Jorge G. Tenreiro, emphasized the importance of registration and transparency in the crypto markets, stating that investors are often deprived of crucial information, leading to substantial risks and losses.

As the crypto market continues to evolve, regulatory bodies like the SEC are taking a more active role in monitoring and enforcing securities laws to protect investors from fraudulent activities and market manipulation.
