Throughout December 2020 and January 2021, SENSO token exhibited unusually high and stable trade volume on Bittrex, KuCoin, and Poloniex. This trading pattern is indicative of wash trading, a practice where market makers create fake activity on exchanges to boost the ranking of a token on sites like CoinMarketCap.

The analysis of the hourly volume on KuCoin by price change for SENSO token in January 2021 reveals a common trick used to fabricate trade volume. This type of activity is often observed when a single entity acts on both sides of the market, buying and selling the same asset back and forth with themselves.

The average transaction size across the three exchanges listing SENSO token further supports the manipulative nature of the trading activity.

This case highlights the potential for market manipulation in the cryptocurrency space, where new projects may engage in wash trading to gain recognition and adoption. Regulatory bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have taken action against market makers and promoters involved in similar schemes, emphasizing the need for investor awareness and market surveillance.
