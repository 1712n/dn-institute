  - Categories: Type of attack
  - Title
- Focus on **facts and numbers** instead of vague phrases and value judgments (such as "huge losses", "important lesson")
- The timeline should use bullet points with dates; no significant events should be missing
- Default to **bullet point structure with titles** - this helps to keep the content concise and focused, and is essential for future attack modeling
