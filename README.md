Distributed Networks Institute (DNI) aims to help infrastructure resilience and financial health of distributed networks through scientific, engineering, and educational efforts. We are a part of a 501(c)3 non-profit incubator in Washington, DC called [BlockShop](https://blockshop.org/). Constantly on the lookout for talent, we encourage anyone to contribute code, market analysis, and engineering expertise to one of our [active projects](https://dn.institute/#projects). Multiple research grants and [code bounties](https://github.com/1712n/dn-institute/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty) are available.

## üèÜ Challenge Program

[![Challenge Program Video](https://blockshopdc.com/static/assets/images/challenge.jpg)](https://link.hygge.work/MayaVick_Challenge)

We maintain a list of real-world problems we work on to give interested individuals a chance to prove themselves, learn a bit about us, and boost their GitHub profiles in the process. The challenge program was so successful for some teams, that they made solving a challenge a hard requirement for joining them. Our challenges are extremely independent and will require you to manage your own time and work process. Check out the [success stories](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/challenge_successstory/) of the challenge winners.

### General rules
* Anyone can participate in a challenge. You do not need anyone's approval to start working or to submit your results.
* Some challenges are paid and have bounties attached to them. When you complete a bounty task, please message bounty-payout@dn.institute with a link to your merged pull request and a Bitcoin or an altcoin address to get paid. We pay all bounties at the end of each month and close tasks as soon as we get enough good quality submissions that fulfill all the requirements.
* By participating in the Challenge Program, you agree to let challenge creators use any and all work submitted for any internal or external purposes.

### Navigating and Working with the Tasks

* In the [issue list](https://github.com/1712n/dn-institute/issues), you'll find a list of tasks that are currently available.
* You are free to start working on any open challenge issue whenever you want.
* For highly complex tasks, we are willing to lock individual issues for qualified candidates to make sure no one else is working on it. For that, please comment in the issue and email challenge@blockshop.org with your CV/profile. We'll review your request and assign the issue exclusively to you.
