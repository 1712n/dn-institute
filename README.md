## Wiki PR Approval Criteria

Before committing to the wikis, please ensure your submission meets the following criteria:

- File name - YYYY-MM-DD-entity-that-was-hacked.md
- Required headers:
  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - Categories: "Type of attack"
  - Title: "Article Title"
- Focus on **facts and numbers** instead of vague phrases and value judgments (such as "huge losses", "important lesson")
- The timeline should use bullet points with dates; no significant events should be missing
- Default to **bullet point structure with titles** - this helps to keep the content concise and focused, and is essential for future attack modeling
- Only **standard sections** are allowed. The attack wiki requires the following sections:
  - Summary
  - Attackers (focus on the attackers, not what they did)
  - Losses
  - Timeline
  - Security Failure Causes
 
If the changes requested by reviewers are not addressed within a week, the PR will be considered stale and will be closed.
